One single flash of glad surprise Just glanced from Isabel's dark eyes, Then vanished in the blush of shame That as its penance instant came-- 'O thought unworthy of my race!' The Lord of the Isles.As little recked Fitzjocelyn of the murmurs which he had provoked, ashe guessed the true secret of his victory. In his eyes, it was thetriumph of merit over prejudice, and Mrs. Frost espoused the samegratifying view, though ascribing much to her nephew's activity, andJames himself, flushed with hope and success, was not likely todissent.Next they had to make their conquest available. Apart from Louis'smagnificent prognostications, at the lowest computation, the headmaster's income amounted to a sum which to James appeared affluence;and though there was no house provided, it mattered the less sincethere were five to choose from in the Terrace, even if hisgrandmother had not wished that their household should be still thesame. With Miss Conway's own fortune and the Terrace settled onherself, where could be any risk?Would Lady Conway think so? and how should the communication be made?James at first proposed writing to her, enclosing a letter to Isabel;but he changed his mind, unable to satisfy himself that, when absentfrom restraint, she might not send a refusal without affording herdaughter the option. He begged his grandmother to write to Isabel;but she thought her letter might carry too much weight, and, whatevermight be her hopes, it was not for her to tell the young lady thatsuch means were sufficient.Louis begged to be the bearer of the letter. His aunt wouldcertainly keep terms with him, and he could insure that the case wasproperly laid before Isabel; and, as there could be no doubt atpresent of his persuasive powers, James caught at the offer. Theparty were still at Beauchastel, and he devised going to his oldquarters at Ebbscreek, and making a descent upon them from thence.When he came to take up his credentials, he found James and hislittle black leathern bag, determined to come at least to Ebbscreekwith him, and declaring it made him frantic to stay at home and leavehis cause in other hands, and that he could not exist anywhere butclose to the scene of action.Captain Hannaford was smoking in his demi-boat, and gave his formerlodgers a hearty welcome, but he twinkled knowingly with his eye, andso significantly volunteered to inform them that the ladies werestill at Beauchastel, that James's wrath at the old skipper'simpudence began to revive, and he walked off to the remotest end ofthe garden.The Captain, remaining with Louis, with whom he was always on farmore easy terms, looked after the other gentleman, winked again, andconfessed that he had suspected one or other of them might be comingthat way this summer, though he could not say he had expected to seethem both together.'Mind, Captain,' said Louis,' it wasn't _I_ that made the boat latethis time last year.''Well! I might be wrong, I fancied you cast an eye that way. Thenmaybe it ain't true what's all over the place here.'Louis pressed to hear what. 'Why, that when the French were going onlike Robert Spear and them old times, he had convoyed the young ladyright through the midst of them, and they would both have been shot,if my Lady's butler hadn't come down with a revolver, killed half-a-dozen of the mob, and rescued them out of it, but that LordFitzjocelyn had been desperately wounded in going back to fetch herbracelet, and Mr. Delaford had carried him out in his arms.''Well!' said Louis, coolly, without altering a muscle of his face, asthe Captain looked for an angry negative.'And when they got home,--so the story went,--Mr. Frost, the tutor,was so mad with jealousy and rage, that my Lady declared thosemoorings would not suit her no longer, but had let go, and laid herhead right for Beauchastel.''Pray what was the young lady supposed to think of the matter?''Stories appeared to vary. One version said that Mr. Delaford hadfound him on his knees to her; and that my Lady had snatched hercruelly away, because she would not have her married before her owndaughters, and looked over all the post, for fear there should be aletter for her. Another declared that Miss Conway would not have himat any price, and was set upon the poor tutor, and that he was lyingdangerously ill of a low fever. --The women will have it so,'observed the Captain, 'the story's everywhere, except maybe in theparlour at Beauchastel, and I wouldn't wonder if Mrs. Mansell knew itall herself, for her maid has a tongue a yard long. I won't say butI thought there might be some grain of truth at the bottom--''And you shall hear it by-and-by, when I know what it is myself.''I'd not say I would have believed it the more if that fine gentlemanhad taken his oath of it--a fellow that ain't to be trusted,'observed the Captain.This might have led to a revelation, if Louis had had time to attendto it; but he had pity on James's impatient misery, and proceeded toask the loan of the boat. The tide would not, however, serve; and aswaiting till it would was not to be endured, the two cousins set offto walk together through the woods, Louis beguiling the way bychaffing James, as far as he would bear, with the idea of Isabel'sname being trifled with by the profane crowd.He left James at the gate of the park, prowling about like a pantherto try for a glimpse of Isabel's window, and feeding his despair andjealousy that Louis should boldly walk up to the door, while he, withso much better a right, was excluded by his unguarded promise to LadyConway.All the tumultuary emotions of his mind were endlessly repeated, andmany a slow and pealing note of the church-clock had added fuel tohis impatience, and spurred him to rush up to the door and claim hisrights, before Louis came bounding past the lodge-gates, flourishinghis cap, and crying, 'Hurrah, Jem! All right!''I'm going to her at once!' cried Jem, beginning to rush off; butLouis caught and imprisoned his arm.'Not so fast, sir! You are to see her. I promise you shall see herif you wish it, but it must be in my aunt's way.''Let me go, I say!''When I have walked five miles in your service, you won't afford mean arm to help me back. I am not a horse with wings, and I won't beCupid's post except on my own terms. Come back.''I don't stir till I have heard the state of the case.''Yes, you do; for all the sportsmen will be coming home, and my auntwould not for all the world that Mr. Mansell caught you on theforbidden ground.''How can you give in to such shuffling nonsense! If I am to claimIsabel openly, why am I not to visit her openly? You have yielded tothat woman's crooked policy. I don't trust you!''When you are her son, you may manage her as you please. Just nowshe has us in her power, and can impose conditions. Come on; and ifyou are good, you shall hear.'Drawing James along with him through the beechwood glades, he began,'You would have been more insane still if you had guessed at my luck.I found Isabel alone. Mrs. Mansell had taken the girls to somejuvenile fete, and Delaford was discreet enough not to rouse my auntfrom her letters. I augured well from the happy conjunction.''Go on; don't waste time in stuff.''Barkis is willing, then. Is that enough to the point?''Fitzjocelyn, you never had any feelings yourself, and therefore youtrifle with those of others.''I beg your pardon. It was a shame! Jem, you may be proud. Shetrusts you completely, and whatever you think sufficient, she regardsas ample.''Like her! Only too like her. Such confidence makes one feel aredoubled responsibility.''I thought I had found something at which you could not grumble.''How does she look? How do they treat her?''Apparently they have not yet fed her on bread and water. No;seriously, I must confess that she looked uncommonly well and lovely!Never mind, Jem; I verily believe that, in spite of absence and allthat, she had never been so happy in her life. If any descriptioncould convey the sweetness of voice and manner when she spoke of you!I could not look in her face. Those looks can only be for you. Wetalked it over, but she heeded no ways and means; it was enough thatyou were satisfied. She says the subject has never been broachedsince the flight from Northwold, and that Lady Conway's kindnessnever varies; and she told me she had little fear but that her dearmamma would be prevailed on to give sanction enough to hinder herfrom feeling as if she were doing wrong, or setting a bad example toher sisters. They know nothing of it; but Walter, who learnt it noone knows how, draws the exemplary moral, that it serves his motherright for inflicting a tutor on him.''Has she had my letter? Does she know I am here?''Wait! All this settled, and luncheon being ready, down came myLady, and we played unconsciousness to our best ability. I mustconfess my aunt beat us hollow! Isabel then left us to ourconference, which we conducted with the gravity of a tailor and anold woman making a match in Brittany.''You came out with that valuable improvable freehold, the Terrace, Isuppose?''I told the mere facts! My aunt was rather grand about a grammar-school; she said even a curacy would sound better, and she must talkit over with Isabel. I gave your letter, conjuring her to let Isabelhave it, and though she declared that it was no kindness, and wouldput the poor darling into needless perplexity, she was touched withmy forbearance, in not having given it before, when I had such anopportunity. So she went away, and stayed a weary while: but whenshe came, it was worth the waiting. She said Isabel was old enoughto know her own mind, and the attachment being so strong, and you sounexceptionable, she did not think it possible to object: she hadgreat delight in seeing you made happy, and fulfilling the dictatesof her own heart, now that it could be done with moderate prudence.They go to Scarborough in a fortnight, and you will be welcome there.There's for you!''Louis, you are the best fellow living! But you said I was to seeher at once.''I asked, why wait for Scarborough?' and depicted you hoveringdisconsolately round the precincts. Never mind, Jem, I did not makeyou more ridiculous than human nature must needs paint a lover, andit was all to melt her heart. I was starting off to fetch you, whenI found she was in great terror. She had never told the Mansells ofthe matter, and they must be prepared. She cannot have it transpirewhile she is in their house, and, in fact, is excessively afraid ofMr. Mansell, and wants to tell her story by letter. Now, I think,considering all things, she has a right to take her own way.''You said I was not to go without meeting her!''I had assented, and was devising how to march off my lunaticquietly, when the feminine goodnatured heart that is in her began torelent, and she looked up in my face with a smile, and said the poordears were really exemplary, and if Isabel should walk to the beachand should meet any one there, she need know nothing about it.''What says Isabel?''She held up her stately head, and thought it would be a betterreturn for Mr. Mansell's kindness to tell him herself before leavingBeauchastel; but Lady Conway entreated her not to be hasty, andprotested that her fears were of Mr. Mansell's displeasure with herfor not having taken better care of her--she dreaded a break, and soon,--till the end of it was, that though we agree that prudence wouldcarry us off to-morrow morning, yet her ladyship will look the otherway, if you happen to be on the southern beach at eleven o'clock to-morrow morning. I suppose you were very headlong and peremptory inyour note, for I could not imagine Isabel consenting to a secrettryste even so authorized.''I never asked for any such thing! I would not for worlds see herled to do anything underhand.''She will honour you! That's right, Jem!''Neither as a clergyman, nor as a Dynevor, can I consent to trickeven those who have no claim to her duty!''Neither as a gentleman, nor as a human creature,' added Louis, inthe same tone. 'Shall I go back and give your answer?''No; you are walking lame enough already.''No matter for that.''To tell you the truth, I can't stand your being with her again,while I am made a fool of by that woman. If I'm not to see her, I'llbe off. I'll send her a note; we will cross to Bickleypool, andstart by the mail-train this very night.'Louis made no objection, and James hurried him into the littleparlour, where in ten minutes the note was dashed off:--My Own Most Precious One!--(as, thanks to my most unselfish ofcousins, I may dare to call you,)--I regret my fervency and urgencyfor an interview, since it led you to think I could purchase evensuch happiness by a subterfuge unworthy of my calling, and an illreturn of the hospitality to which we owed our first meeting. Wewill meet when I claim you in the face of day, without the sense ofstolen felicity, which is a charm to common-place minds. My glory isin the assurance that you understand my letter, approve, and arerelieved. With such sanction, and with ardour before you like mine,I see that you could do no other than consent, and there is not ashadow of censure in my mind; but if, without compromising your senseof obedience, you could openly avow our engagement to Mr. Mansell, Iown that I should feel that we were not drawn into a compromise ofsincerity. What this costs me I will not say; it will be bareexistence till we meet at Scarborough. 'Your own, J. E. F. D.'Having written this and deposited it in the Ebbscreek post-office,James bethought himself that his submissive cousin had thrown himselfon the floor, with his bag for a pillow, trying to make the most ofthe few moments of rest before the midnight journey. Seized withcompunction, James exclaimed, 'There, old fellow, we will stay to-night.''Thank you--' He was too sleepy for more.The delay was recompensed. James was trying to persuade Louis torouse himself to be revived by bread-and-cheese and beer, and couldextort nothing but a drowsy repetition of the rhyme, in old days thewar-cry of the Grammar-school against the present headmaster,-- 'The Welshman had liked to be choked by a mouse, But he pulled him out by the tail,'--when an alarum came in the shape of a little grinning boy fromBeauchastel, with a note on which James had nearly laid hands, as hesaw the writing, though the address was to the Viscount Fitzjocelyn.'You may have it,' said Louis. 'If anything were wanting, thecoincidence proves that you were cut out for one another. I rejoicethat the moon does not stoop from her sphere.''My Dear Cousin,--I trust to you to prevent Mr. F. Dynevor from beinghurt or disappointed; and, indeed, I scarcely think he will, though Ishould not avail myself of the permission for meeting him so kindlyintended. I saw at once that you felt as I did, and as I know hewill. He would not like me to have cause to blush before my kindfriends--to know that I had acted a deceit, nor to set an example tomy sisters for which they might not understand the justification. Iknow that you will obtain my pardon, if needed; and to be assured ofit, would be all that would be required to complete the gratefulhappiness of 'Isabel.'The boy had orders not to wait; and these being seconded by fears ofsomething that 'walked' in Ebbscreek wood after dark, he was gonebefore an answer could be thought of. It mattered the less, sinceIsabel must receive James's note early in the morning; and so, infact, she did--and she was blushing over it, and feeling as if shecould never have borne to meet his eye but for the part she hadfortunately taken, when Louisa tapped at her door, with a messagethat Mr. Mansell wished to speak with her, if she were ready.She went down-stairs still in a glow; and her old friend's firstwords were a compliment on her roses, so pointed, that she doubtedfor a moment whether he did not think them suspicious, especially ashe put his hands behind his back, and paced up and down the room, forsome moments. He then came towards her, and said, in a very kindtone, 'Isabel, my dear, I sent for you first, because I knew your ownmother very well, my dear; and though Lady Conway is very kind, andhas always done you justice,--that I will always say for her,--yetthere are times when it may make a difference to a young womanwhether she has her own mother or not.'Isabel's heart was beating. She was certain that some discovery hadbeen made, and longed to explain; but she was wise enough not tospeak in haste, and waited to see how the old gentleman would finallybreak it to her. He blundered on a little longer, becoming moreconfused and distressed every minute, and at last came to the pointabruptly. 'In short, Isabel, my dear, what can you have done to setpeople saying that you have been corresponding with the young men atEbbscreek?''I sent a note to my cousin Fitzjocelyn last night,' said Isabel,with such calmness, that the old gentleman fairly stood with hismouth open, looking at her aghast.'Fitzjocelyn! Then it is Fitzjocelyn, is it?' he exclaimed. 'Then,why could he not set about it openly and honourably? Does his fatherobject? I would not have thought it of you, Isabel, nor of the ladneither!''You need not think it, dear Mr. Mansell. There is nothing betweenLord Fitzjocelyn and myself but the warmest friendship.''Isabel! Isabel! why are you making mysteries? I do not wish to pryinto your affairs. I would have trusted you anywhere; but when itcomes round to me that you have been sending a private messenger toone of the young gentlemen there, I don't know what to be at! Iwould not believe Mrs. Mansell at first; but I saw the boy, and hesaid you had sent him yourself. My dear, you may mean, very rightly-I am sure you do, but you must not set people talking! It is notacting rightly by me, Isabel; but I would not care for that, if itwere acting rightly by yourself.' And he gazed at her with apiteous, perplexed expression.'Let me call mamma,' said Isabel.'As you will, my dear, but cannot you let the simple truth come outbetween you and your own blood-relation, without all her words tocome between? Can't you, Isabel? I am sure you and I shallunderstand each other.''That we shall,' replied Isabel, warmly. 'I have given her nopromise. Dear Mr. Mansell, I have wished all along that you shouldknow that I am engaged, with her full consent, to Mr. Frost Dynevor.''To the little black tutor!' cried Mr. Mansell, recoiling, butrecollecting himself. 'I beg your pardon, my dear, he may be a verygood man, but what becomes of all this scrambling over barricadeswith the young Lord?'Isabel described the true history of her engagement; and it wasreceived with a long, low whistle, by no means too complimentary.'And what makes him come and hide in holes and corners, if this isall with your mamma's good will?''Mamma thought you would be displeased; she insisted on taking herown time for breaking it to you,' said Isabel.'Was there ever a woman but must have her mystery? Well, I shouldhave liked him better if he had not given into it!''He never did!' said Isabel, indignant enough to disclose in full thewhole arrangement made by Lady Conway's manoeuvres and lax good-nature. 'I knew it would never do,' she added, 'though I could notsay so before her and Fitzjocelyn. My note was to tell them so: andlook here, Mr. Mansell, this is what Mr. Dynevor had already writtenbefore receiving mine.'She held it out proudly; and Mr. Manaell, making an unwilling soundbetween his teeth, took it from her; but, as he read, his countenancechanged, and he exclaimed, 'Ha! very well! This is something like!So that's it, is it? You and he would not combine to cheat the oldman, like a pair of lovers in a trumpery novel!''No, indeed!' said Isabel, 'that would be a bad way of beginning.''Where is the young fellow?--at Ebbscreek, did you say? I'll tellyou what, Isabel,' with his hand on the bell, 'I'll have out thedogcart this minute, and fetch him home to breakfast, to meet my Ladywhen she comes down stairs, if it be only for the sake of showingthat I like plain dealing!''Isabel could only blush, smile, look doubtful, and yet so very happyand grateful, that Mr. Mansell became cautious, lest his impulseshould have carried him too far, and, after having ordered thevehicle to be prepared, he caught her by the hand, and detained her,saying, 'Mind you, Miss, you are not to take this for over-much. I'mafraid it is a silly business, and I did not want you to throwyourself away on a schoolmaster. I must see and talk to the manmyself; but I won't have anything that's not open and above-board,and that my Lady shall see for once in her life!''I'm not afraid,' said Isabel, smiling. 'James will make his own waywith you.'Isabel ran away to excuse and explain her confession to Lady Conway;while Mr. Mansell indulged in another whistle, and then went toinform his wife that he was afraid the girl had been making a fool ofherself; but it was not Lady Conway's fault that she was nothingworse, and he was resolved, whatever he did, to show that honesty wasthe only thing that would go down with him.The boat was rocking on the green waves, and Louis was in the act ofwaving an adieu to deaf Mrs. Hannaford, when a huntsman's halloocaused James to look round and behold Mr. Mansell standing up in hisdogcart, making energetic signals with his whip.He had meant to be very guarded, and wait to judge of James beforeshowing that he approved, but the excitement of the chase betrayedhim into a glow of cordiality, and he shook hands with vehemence.'That's right!--just in time! Jump in, and come home to breakfast.So you wouldn't be a party to my Lady's tricks!--just like her--justas she wheedled poor Conway. I will let her see how I esteem plaindealing! I don't say that I see my way through this business; butwe'll talk it over together, and settle matters without my Lady.'James hardly knew where he was, between joy and surprise. Theinvitation was extended to his companion; but Fitzjocelyn discernedthat both James and Mr. Mansell would prefer being left tothemselves; he had a repugnance to an immediate discussion with theone aunt, and was in haste to carry the tidings to the other: andbesides, it was becoming possible that letters might arrive from thetravellers. Actuated by all these motives, he declined the offer ofhospitality, and rowed across to Bickleypool, enlightening theCaptain on the state of affairs as far as he desired.CHAPTER II.THE THIRD TIME. Tho' this was fair, and that was braw, And you the toast of all the town, I sighed and said, amang them a', Ye are not Mary Morison. BURNS.Mrs. Frost and Louis were very merry over the result of Lady Conway'sstratagems, and sat up indulging in bright anticipations until solate an hour, that Louis was compelled to relinquish his purpose ofgoing home that night, but he persisted in walking to Ormersfieldbefore breakfast, that he might satisfy himself whether there wereany letters.It was a brisk October morning, the sportsman's gun and whistle re-echoing from the hill sides; where here and there appeared the dogscareering along over green turnip-fields or across amber stubble.The Little Northwold trees, in dark, sober tints of brown and purple,hung over the grey wall, tinted by hoary lichen; and as Louis enteredthe Ormersfield field paths, and plunged into his own Ferny dell, thelong grass and brackens hung over the path, weighed down with silverydew, and the large cavernous web of the autumnal spider was all onethick flake of wet.If he could not enter the ravine without thankfulness for his pastescape, neither could he forget gratitude to her who had come to hisrelief from hopeless agony! He quickened his pace, in the earnestlonging for tidings, which had seized him, even to heart sickness.It was the reaction of the ardour and excitement that had so longpossessed him. The victory had been gained--he had been obliged toleave James to work in his own cause, and would be no longer wantedin the same manner by his cousin. The sense of loneliness, and ofthe want of an object, came strongly upon him as he walked throughthe prim old solitary garden, and looked up at the dreary windows ofthe house, almost reluctant to enter, as long as it was withoutMary's own serene atmosphere of sympathy and good sense, her preciousoffices of love, her clear steady eyes, even in babyhood histrustworthy counsellors.Was it a delusion of fancy, acting on reflections in the glass, that,as he mounted the steps from the lawn, depicted Mary's figure throughthe dining-room windows? Nay, the table was really laid forbreakfast--a female figure was actually standing over the tea-chest.'A scene from the Vicar of Wakefield deluding me,' decided Louis,advancing to the third window, which was open.It was Mary Ponsonby.'Mary!''You here?--They said you were not at home!''My father!--Where?''He is not come down. He is as well as possible. We came at elevenlast night. I found I was not wanted,' added Mary, with a degree ofagitation, that made him conclude that she had lost her father.One step he made to find the Earl, but too much excited to move awayor to atand still, he came towards her, wrung her hand in a more realway than in his first bewildered surprise, and exclaimed intransport, 'O Mary! Mary! to have you back again!' then, rememberinghis inference, added, low and gravely, 'It makes me selfish--I wasnot thinking of your grief.''Never mind,' said Mary, smiling, though her eyes overflowed, 'I mustbe glad to be at home again, and such a welcome as this--''O Mary, Mary!' he cried, nearly beside himself, 'I have not knownwhat to do without you! You will believe it now, won't you?'--oh,won't you?'Mary would have been a wonderful person had she not instantly andutterly forgotten all her conclusions from Frampton's having declaredhim gone to Beauchastel for an unlimited time; but all she did was toturn away her crimson tearful face, and reply, 'Your father would notwish it now.''Then the speculations have failed? So much the better!''No, no! he must tell you--'She was trying to withdraw her hand, when Lord Ormersfield opened thedoor, and in the moment of his amazed 'Louis!' Mary had fled.'What is it? oh! what is it, father? cried Louis for all greeting,'why can she say you would not wish it now?''Wish it? wish what?' asked the Earl, without the intuitiveperception of the meaning of the pronoun.'What you have always wished--Mary and me--What is the only happinessthat life can offer me!''If I wished it a year ago, I could only wish it the more now,' saidthe Earl. 'But how is this?--I fully believed you committed to MissConway.''Miss Conway! Miss Conway!' burst out Louis, in a frenzy. 'BecauseJem Frost was in love with her himself, he fancied every one elsemust be the same, and now he will be married to her before Christmas,so that's disposed of. As to my feeling for her a particle, a shredof what I do for Mary, it was a mere fiction--a romance, animpossibility.''I do not understand you, Louis. Why did you not find this outbefore?''Mrs. Ponsonby called it my duty to test my feelings, and I havetested them. That one is a beautiful poet's dream. Mary is a woman,the only woman I can ever love. Not an hour but I have felt it, andnow, father, what does she mean?''She means, poor girl, what only her own scrupulous delicacy couldregard as an objection, but what renders me still more desirous tohave a right to protect her. The cause of our return--''How? I thought her father was dead.''Far worse. At Valparaiso we met Robson, the confidential agent. Ilearnt from him that Mr. Ponsonby had hardly waited for her mother'sdeath to marry a Limenian, a person whom everything pointed out asunfit to associate with his daughter. Even Robson, cautious as hewas, said he could not undertake to recommend Miss Ponsonby tocontinue her journey.''And this was all?' exclaimed Louis, too intent on his own views foranything but relief.'All? Is it not enough to set her free? She acquiesced in myjudgment that she could do no otherwise than return. She wrote toher father, and I sent three lines to inform him that, under thecircumstances, I fulfilled my promise to her mother by taking herhome. I had nearly made her promise that, should we find you aboutto form an establishment of your own, she would consider herself asmy child; but--''Oh, father! how shall we make her believe you care nothing for herscruple? The wretched man! But--oh! where is she?''It does not amount to a scruple in her case,' deliberately resumedthe Earl. 'I always knew what Ponsonby was, and nothing from himcoldd surprise me--even such an outrage on feeling and decency.Besides, he has effectually shut himself out of society, and degradedhimself beyond the power of interfering with you. For the rest, Maryis already, in feeling, so entirely my child, that to have the rightto call her so has always been my fondest wish. And, Louis, themonths I have spent with her have not diminished my regard. My Mary!she will have a happier lot than her mother!'The end of the speech rewarded Louis for the conflict by which he hadkept himself still to listen to the beginning. Lord Ormersfield hadpity on him, and went in search of Mary; while he, remembering formerpassages, felt that his father might be less startling and morepersuasive, but began to understand what James must have suffered incommitting his affairs to another.The Earl found Mary in what had been her mother's sitting-room,striving to brace her resolution by recalling the conversation thathad taken place there on a like occasion. But alas! how much morethe heart had now to say! How much it felt as if the only shelter orrest in the desolate world was in the light of the blue eyes whosetender sunshine had been on her for one instant!Yet she began firmly--'If you please, would you be so kind as to letme go to Aunt Melicent?''By-and-by, my dear, when you think fit.''Oh, then, at once, and without seeing any one, please!''Nay, Mary,' with redoubled gentleness, 'there is one who cannot letyou go without seeing him. Mary, you will not disappoint my poor boyagain. You will let him be an amendment in my scheme.''You have been always most kind to me, but you cannot really likethis.''You forget that it has been my most ardent wish from the moment Isaw you what only your mother's child could be.''That was before-- No, I ought not! Yours is not a family to bringdisgrace into.''I cannot allow you to speak thus. I knew your trials at home whenfirst I wished you to be my son's wife, and my opinion is unchanged,except by my increased wish to have the first claim to you.''Lord Ormersfield,' said Mary, collecting herself 'only one thing.Tell me, as if we were indifferent persons, is this a connexion suchas would do Louis any harm? I trust you to answer.'He paced along the room, and she tried to control her trembling. Hecame back and spoke: No, Mary. If he were a stranger, I should givethe same advice. Your father's own family is unexceptionable; andthose kind of things, so far off--few will ever hear of them, and noone will attach consequence to them. If that be your only scruple,it does you infinite credit; but I can entirely remove it. Whatmight be an injury to you, single, would be of comparatively littleimportance to him.''Miss Conway,' faltered Mary, who could never remember her, when inLouis's presence.'A mere delusion, of our own. There was nothing in it. He calls youthe only woman who can make him happy, as I always knew you were. Hemust explain all. You will come to him, my dear child.'Mary resisted no more; he led her down stairs, and left her withinthe dining-room door.'Mary, you will now--' was all Louis said; but she let him draw herinto his arms, and she rested against his breast, as when he had cometo comfort her in the great thunderstorm in auld lang-syne. She feltherself come at length to the shelter and repose for which her hearthad so long yearned, in spite of her efforts, and as if the world hadnothing more to offer of peace or joy.'Oh, Mary, how I have wanted you! You believe in me now!''I am sure mamma would!' murmured Mary.He could have poured forth a torrent of affection, but the suspicionof a footstep made her start from him; and the next moment she washerself, glowing, indeed, and half crying with happiness, but alarmedat her own agitation, and struggling to resume her common-placemanner.'There's your father not had a morsel of breakfast!' she exclaimed,hurrying back to her teacups, whose ringing betrayed her tremblinghand. 'Call him, Louis.''Must I go?' said Louis, coming to assist in a manner that threateneddeluge and destruction.'Oh yes, go! I shall be able to speak to you when you come back.'He had only to go into the verandah. His father was watching at thelibrary window, and they wrung each other's hand in gladness beyondutterance.Mary had seated herself in the solid stately chair, with the wholeentrenchment of tea equipage before her. They knew it signified thatshe was to be unmolested; they took their places, and the Earl carvedham, and Louis cut bread, and Mary poured out tea in the most matter-of-fact manner, hazarding nothing beyond such questions as, 'May Igive you an egg?'Then curiosity began to revive: Louis ventured, 'Where did you land?'and his father made answer, 'At Liverpool, yesterday,' and how theCustom-house had detained them, and he had, therefore, brought Marystraight home, instead of stopping with her at Northwold, at eleveno'clock, to disturb Mrs. Frost.'You would have found us up,' said Louis.'You were sleeping at the Terrace?''Yes, I walked here this morning.''Then your ankle must be pretty well,' was Mary's first contributionto the conversation.'Quite well for all useful purposes,' said Louis, availing himself ofthe implied permission to turn towards her.'But, Louis,' suddenly exclaimed the Earl, 'did you not tell mesomething extraordinary about James Frost? Whom did you say he wasgoing to marry?''Isabel Conway.'Never was his love of electrifying more fully gratified! LordOrmersfield was surprised into an emphatic interjection, and inquirywhether they were all gone mad.'Not that I am aware of,' said Louis. 'Perhaps you have not heardthat Mr. Lester is going to retire, and Jem has the school?''Then, it must be Calcott and the trustees who are out of theirsenses.''Do you not consider it an excellent appointment?''It might be so some years hence,' said the Earl. 'I am afraid itwill tie him down to a aecond-rate affair, when he might be doingbetter; and the choice is the last thing I should have expected fromCalcott.''He opposed it. He wanted to bring in a very ordinary style ofperson, from -- School, but Jem's superiority and the general esteemfor my aunt carried the day.''What did Ramsbotham and his set do?''They were better than could have been hoped; they gave us theirvotes when they found their man could not get in.''Ha? As long as that fellow is against Calcott, he cares little whomhe supports. I am sorry that Calcott should be defeated, even forJames's sake. How did Richardson vote?''He was doubtful at first, but I brought him over.'Lord Ormersfield gave a quick, searching glance as he said,' JamesFrost did not make use of our interest in this matter.''Jem never did. He and my aunt held back, and were unwilling tooppose the Squire. They would have given it up, but for me. Father,I never supposed you could be averse to my doing my utmost for Jem,when all his prospects were at stake.''I should have imagined that James was too well aware of mysentiments to allow it.'What a cloud on the happy morning!Louis eagerly exclaimed: 'James is the last person to be blamed! Heand my aunt were always trying to stop me, but I would not listen totheir scruples. I knew his happiness depended on his success, and Iworked for him, in spite of himself. If I did wrong, I can only bevery sorry; but I cannot readily believe that I transgressed bysetting the question before people in a right light. Only, whosefault soever it was, it was not Jem's.'Lord Ormersfield had not the heart to see one error in his son onsuch a day as this, more especially as Mary peeped out behind the urnto judge of his countenance, and he met her pleading eyes, swimmingin tears.'No, I find no fault,' he kindly said. 'Young, ardent spirits may beexcused for outrunning the bounds that their elders might impose.But you have not removed my amazement. James intending to marry onthe grammar-school!--it cannot be worth 300 pounds a year.''Isabel is satisfied. She never desired anything but a quiet,simple, useful life.''Your Aunt Catharine delighted, of course? No doubt of that; butwhat has come to Lady Conway?''She cannot help it, and makes the best of it. She gave us verylittle trouble.''Ah! her own daughter is growing up,' said the Earl, significantly.'Isabel is very fond of Northwold,' said Mary, feeling that Louis waswanting her sympathy. 'She used to wish she could settle there--withhow little consciousness!''If I had to judge in such a case,' said Lord Ormersfield,thoughtfully, 'I should hesitate to risk a woman's happiness with atemper such as that of James Frost.''Oh, father!' cried Louis, indignantly.'I suspect,' said Lord Ormersfield, smiling, 'that of late years,James's temper has been more often displayed towards me than towardsyou.''A certain proof how safe his wife will be,' returned Louis.His father shook his head, and looking from one to the other of theyoung people, congratulated himself that here, at least, there wereno perils of that description. He asked how long the attachment hadexisted.'From the moment of first sight,' said Louis; 'the fine spark waslighted on the Euston Square platform; and it was not much laterwith her. He filled up her beau ideal of goodness--''And, in effect, all Lady Conway's pursuit of you threw themtogether,' said Lord Ormersfield, much entertained.'Lady Conway has been their very best friend, without intending it.It would not have come to a crisis by this time, if she had not takenme to Paris. It would have been a pity if the catastrophe of thebarricades had been all for nothing.'Lord Ormersfield and Mary here broke out in amazement at themselves,for having hitherto been oblivious of the intelligence that hadgreeted them on their first arrival, when Frampton had informed themof Lord Fitzjocelyn's wound and gallant conduct, and his father hadlistened to the story like the fastening of a rivet in Miss Conway'schains, and Mary with a flush of unselfish pride that Isabel had beentaught to value her hero. They both claimed the true and detailedaccount, as if they had hitherto been defrauded of it, and insistedon hearing what had happened to him.'I dare say you know best,' said Louis, lazily. 'I have heard somany different accounts of late, that I really am beginning to forgetwhich is the right one, and rather incline to the belief thatDelaford brought a rescue or two with his revolver, and carried usinto a fortress where my aunt had secured the windows with feather-beds--''You had better make haste and tell, that the true edition may bepreserved,' said Mary, rallying her spirits in her eagerness.'I have begun to understand why there never yet has been an authenticaccount of a great battle,' said Louis. 'Life would make me coincidewith Sir Robert Walpole's judgment on history. All I am clear aboutis, that even a Red Republican is less red than he is painted; thatIsabel Conway is fit to visit the sentinels in a beleaguered castle--a noble being-- But oh, Mary! did I not long sorely after you when.it came to the wounded knight part of the affair! I am more sure ofthat than of anything else!'Mary blushed, but her tender heart was chiefly caring to know howmuch he had been hurt, and so the whole story was unfolded by duequestioning; and the Earl had full and secret enjoyment of the signaldefeat of his dear sister-in-law, the one satisfaction on which everyone seemed agreed.It was a melancholy certainty that Mary must go to Mrs. Frost, butthe Earl deferred the moment by sending the carriage with an entreatythat she would come herself to fetch her guest. Mary talked ofwriting a note; but the autumn sun shone cheerily on the steps, andLouis wiled her into seating herself on the upper step, while hereclined on the lower ones, as they had so often been placed whenthis was his only way of enjoying the air. The sky was clear, theair had the still calm of autumn, the evergreens and the yellow-fringed elms did not stir a leaf--only a large heavy yellow planeleaf now and then detached itself by its own weight and silentlyfloated downwards. Mary sat, without wishing to utter a word todisturb the unwonted tranquillity, the rest so precious after hermonths of sea-voyage, her journey, her agitations. But Louis wantedher seal of approval to all his past doings, and soon began on theirinner and deeper story, ending with, 'Tell me whether you think I wasright, my own dear governess--''Oh no, you must never call me that any more.''It is a name belonging to my happiest days.''It was only in play. It reverses the order of things. I must lookup to you.''If you can!' aaid Louis, playfully, slipping down to a lower step.A tear burst out as Mary said, 'Mamma said it must never be thatway.' Then recovering, she added, 'I beg your pardon, Louis; I wastreating it as earnest. I think I am not quite myself to-day, I willgo to my room!''No, no, don't,' he said; 'I will not harass you with my gladness,dearest.' He stepped in-doors, brought out a book, and when Mrs.Frost arrived to congratulate and be congratulated, she found Marystill on the step, gazing on without seeing the trees and flowers,listening without attending to the rich, soothing flow of Lope deVega's beautiful devotional sonnets, in majestic Spanish, in Louis'slow, sweet voice.CHAPTER III.MISTS. Therefore thine eye through mist of many days Shines bright; and beauty, like a lingering rose, Sits on thy cheek, and in thy laughter plays; While wintry frosts have fallen on thy foes, And, like a vale that breathes the western sky, Thy heart is green, though summer is gone by. F. TENNYSON.Happy Aunt Kitty!--the centre, the confidante of so much love!Perhaps her enjoyment was the most keen and pure of all, because themost free from self--the most devoid of those cares for the morrow,which, after besetting middle life, often so desert old age as torender it as free and fresh as childhood. She had known the worst:she had been borne through by heart-whole faith and love, she hadseen how often frettings for the future were vain, and experiencedthat anticipation is worse than reality. Where there was trueaffection and sound trust, she could not, would not, and did not fearfor those she loved.James went backwards and forwards in stormy happiness. He had cometo a comfortable understanding with old Mr. Mansell, who had treatedhim with respect and cordiality from the first, giving him tounderstand that Isabel's further expectations only amounted to alegacy of a couple of thousands on his own death, and that meantimehe had little or no hope of helping him in his profession. He spokeof Isabel's expensive habits, and the danger of her finding itdifficult to adapt herself to a small income; and though, of course,he might as well have talked to the wind as to either of the lovers,his remonstrance was so evidently conscientious as not to be in theleast offensive, and Mr. Frost Dynevor was graciously pleased toaccept him as a worthy relation.All was smooth likewise with Lady Conway. She and Mr. Manselloutwardly appeared utterly unconscious of each other's proceedings,remained on the most civil terms, and committed their comments andexplanations to Mrs. Mansell, who administered them according to herown goodnatured, gossiping humour, and sided with whichever wasspeaking to her. There was in Lady Conway much kindness and good-humour, always ready to find satisfaction in what was inevitable, andwilling to see all at ease and happy around her--a quality which sheshared with Louis, and which rendered her as warm and even caressingto 'our dear James' as if he had been the most welcome suitor in theworld; and she often sincerely congratulated herself on theacquisition of a sensible gentleman to consult on business, and soexcellent a brother for Walter. It was not falsehood, it was realamiability; and it was an infinite comfort in the courtship,especially the courtship of a Pendragon. As to the two youngsisters, their ecstasy was beyond description, only alloyed by thegrief of losing Isabel, and this greatly mitigated by schemes ofvisits to Northwold.The marriage was fixed for the end of November, so as to give timefor a little tranquillity before the commencement of James's newduties. As soon as this intelligence arrived, Mrs. Frost removedherself, Mary, and her goods into the House Beautiful, that No. 5might undergo the renovations which, poor thing! had been plannedtwenty years since, when poor Henry's increasing family and growingdifficulties had decided her that she could 'do without them' oneyear more.'Even should Miss Conway not like to keep house with the old woman,'said she, by way of persuading herself she had no such expectation,'it was her duty to keep the place in repair.'That question was soon at rest: Isabel would be but too happy to beallowed to share her home, and truly James would hardly have attachedhimself to a woman who could not regard it as a privilege to be withthe noble old lady. Clara was likewise to be taken home; Isabelundertook to complete her education, and school and tuition were bothto be removed from the contemplation of the happy girl, whose lettershad become an unintelligible rhapsody of joy and affection.Isabel had three thousand pounds of her own, which, with thatvaluable freehold, Dynevor Terrace, James resolved should be settledon herself, speaking of it with such solemn importance as to provokethe gravity of those accustomed to deal with larger sums. With theinterest of her fortune he meant to insure his life, that, as he toldLouis, with gratified prudence, there might be no repetition of hisown case, and his family might never be a burden on any one.The income of the school, with their former well-husbanded means, wasaffluence for the style to which he aspired; and his grandmother,though her menus plaisirs had once doubled her present revenue,regarded it as the same magnificent advance, and was ready to launchinto the extravagance of an additional servant, and of fitting up thelong-disused drawing-room, and the dining-parlour, hitherto calledthe school-room, and kicked and hacked by thirty years of boys. Sheand Clara would betake themselves to their present little sitting-room, and make the drawing-room pleasant and beautiful for the bride.And in what a world of upholstery did not the dear old lady spend theautumn months! How surpassingly happy was Jane, and howcommunicative about Cheveleigh! and how pleased and delighted inlittle Charlotte's promotion!And Charlotte! She ought to have been happy, with her higher wagesand emancipation from the more unpleasant work, with the expectationof one whom she admired so enthusiastically as Miss Conway, and,above all, with the long, open-hearted, affectionate letter, whichMiss Ponsonby had put into her hand with so kind a smile. Somehow,it made her do nothing but cry; she felt unwilling to sit down andanswer it; and, as if it were out of perverseness, when she was inMrs. Martha's very house, and when there was so much to be done, shetook the most violent fit of novel-reading that had ever been known;and when engaged in working or cleaning alone, chanted dismal balladsof the type of 'Alonzo the brave and the fair Imogens,' till Mrs.Martha declared that she was just as bad as an old dumbledore, andnot worth half so much.One day, however, Miss Ponsonby called her into her room, to tell herthat a parcel was going to Lima, in case she wished to send anythingby it. Miss Ponsonby spoke so kindly, and yet so delicately, andCharlotte blushed and faltered, and felt that she must write now!'I have been wishing to tell you, Charlotte,' added Mary, kindly,'how much we like Mr. Madison. There were some very undesirablepeople among the passengers, who might easily have led him astray;but the captain and mate both spoke to Lord Ormersfield in thehighest terms of his behaviour. He never missed attending prayers onthe Sundays; and, from all I could see, I do fully believe that he isa sincerely good, religions man; and, if he keeps on as he has begun,I think you are very happy in belonging to him.'Charlotte only curtsied and thanked; but it was wonderful how thosekind, sympathizing words blew off at once the whole mists of nonsenseand fancy. Tom was the sound, good, religious man to whom her heartand her troth were given; the other was no such thing, a mereflatterer, and she had known it all along. She would never think ofhim again, and she was sure he would not think of her. Truth haddispelled all the fancied sense of hypocrisy and double-dealing: shesat down and wrote to Tom as if Delaford had never existed, andforthwith returned to be herself again, at least for the present.Poor Mary! she might speak cheerfully, but her despatches were madeup with a trembling heart. Louis and Mary missed the security andfelicity that seemed so perfect with James and Isabel. In the firstplace, nothing could be fixed without further letters, although theEarl had tried to persuade Mary that her father had virtuallyforfeited all claim to her obedience, and that she ought to proceedas if in fact an orphan, and secure herself from being harassed byhim, by hastening her marriage. Of this she would not hear, and shewas exceedingly grateful to Louis for abstaining from pressing her,as well as for writing to Mr. Ponsonby in terms against which noexception could be taken.Till secure of his consent, she would not consider her engagement asmore than conditional, nor consent to its being mentioned to any one.If Isabel knew it, that was James's fault. Even the Faithfullsisters were kept in ignorance; and she trusted thus to diminish thewrong that she felt her secrecy to be doing to Aunt Melicent, who wasso much vexed and annoyed at her return, that she dreaded exceedinglythe effect of the knowledge of her engagement. Miss Ponsonby wasconvinced that the news had been exaggerated, and insisted that butfor Lord Ormersfield's dislike, it would have been further sifted;and she wrote to Mary to urge her coming to her to await the fulltidings, instead of delaying among her father's avowed enemies.Mary settled this point by mentioning her promise to Mrs. Frost toremain with her until her grandchildren should be with her; and MissPonsonby's correspondence ceased after a dry, though still kindletter, which did not make Mary more willing to bestow herconfidence, but left her feeling in her honest heart as if she weredealing insincerely by Aunt Melicent.The discretion and reserve rendered requisite by the concealment weresuch as to be very tormenting even to so gentle a temper as that ofLouis, since they took from him all the privileges openly granted tothe cousin, and scarcely left him those of the friend. She, on whosearm he had leant all last summer, would not now walk with him withoutan escort, and, even with Mrs. Frost beside her, shrank fromOrmersfield like forbidden ground. Her lively, frank tone of playfulcommand had passed away; nay, she almost shrank from his confidence,withheld her counsel, and discouraged his constant visits. He couldnot win from her one of her broad, fearless comments on his pastdoings; and in his present business, the taking possession ofInglewood, the choice of stock, and the appointment of a bailiff,though she listened and sympathized, and answered questions, shevolunteered no opinions, ahe expressed no wishes, she would not cometo see.Poor Louis was often mortified into doubts of his own ability tointerest or make her happy; but he was very patient. If disappointedone day, he was equally eager the next; he submitted obediently toher restrictions, and was remorseful when he forgot or transgressed;and they had real, soothing, comforting talks just often enough to betantalizing, and yet to convince him that all the otherunsatisfactory meetings and partings were either his own fault, orthat of some untoward circumstance.He saw, as did the rest, that Mary's spirits had received a shock noteasily to be recovered. The loss of her mother was weighing on hermore painfully than in the first excitement; and the step her fatherhad taken, insulting her mother, degrading himself, and rending awayher veil of filial honour, had exceedingly overwhelmed and depressedher; while sorrow hung upon her with the greater permanence andoppression from her strong self-control, and dislike tomanifestation.All this he well understood; and, reverent to her feeling, he laidaside all trifling, and waited on her mood with the tenderestwatchfulness. When she could bear it, they would dwell together onthe precious recollections of her mother; and sometimes she couldeven speak of her father, and relate instances of his affection forherself, and all his other redeeming traits of character; mostthankful to Louis for accepting him on her word, and never utteringone word of him which she could wish unsaid.What Louis did not see, was that the very force of her own affectionwas what alarmed Mary, and caused her reserve. To a mind used tobalance and regulation, any sensation so mighty and engrossingappeared wrong; and repressed as her attachment had been, it was themore absorbing now that he was all that was left to her. Admiration,honour, gratitude, old childish affection, and caressing elder-sisterly protection, all flowed in one deep, strong current; but thevery depth made her diffident. She could imagine the wholereciprocated, and she feared to be importunate. If the day was nobetter than a weary turmoil, save when his voice was in her ear, hiseyes wistfully bent on her, the more carefully did she restrain allexpression of hope of seeing him to-morrow, lest she should beexacting and detain him from projects of his own. If it was prideand delight to her to watch his graceful, agile figure spring onhorseback, she would keep herself from the window, lest he shouldfeel oppressed by her pursuing him; and when she found her advicesought after as his law, she did not venture to proffer it. She wasuncomfortable in finding the rule committed to her, and all the morebecause Lord Ormersfield, who had learnt to talk to her so openlythat she sometimes thought he confounded her with her mother, used inall his schemes to appear to take it for granted that she shouldshare with him in the managing, consulting headship of the house,leaving Louis as something to be cared for and petted like a child,without a voice in their decisions. These conversations used to makeher almost jealous on Louis's account, and painfully recall some ofher mother's apprehensions.That was the real secret source of all her discomfort--namely, themisgiving lest she had been too ready to follow the dictates of herown heart. Would her mother have been satisfied? Had not herfondness and her desolation prevailed, where, for Louis's own sake,she should have held back! Every time she felt herself the elder inheart, every time she feared to have disappointed him, every time shesaw that his liveliness was repressed by her mournfulness, she fearedthat she was letting him sacrifice himself. And still more did shequestion her conduct towards her father. She had only graduallybecome aware of the extent of the mutual aversion between him and theEarl; and Miss Ponsonby's reproaches awakened her to the fear thatshe had too lightly given credence to hostile evidence. Heraffection would fain have justified him; and, forgetting thedifficulties of personal investigation in such a case, she blamedherself for having omitted herself to question the confidentialclerk, and having left all to Lord Ormersfield, who, cool and wary ashe ordinarily was, would be less likely to palliate Mr. Ponsonby'serrors than those of any other person. Her heart grew sick as shecounted the weeks ere she could hear from Lima.None of her troubles were allowed to interfere with Mrs. Frost'speace. Outwardly, she was cheerful and helpful; equable, though lesslively. Those carpets and curtains, tables and chairs, which werethe grand topics at the House Beautiful, were neither neglected nortreated with resigned impatience. Mary's taste, counsel, and needledid good service; her hearty interest and consideration were given tothe often-turned volume of designs for bedsteads, sofas, and window-curtains; and Miss Mercy herself had hardly so many resources formaking old furniture new. Many of her happiest half-hours with Louiswere spent as she sewed the stiff slippery chintz, and he held thecurtain rings, while Aunt Catharine went to inspect the workmen, andmany a time were her cares forgotten, and her active spirits resumed,while Louis acted carpenter under her directions, and rectifiederrors of the workmen. It might not be poetical, but the French sky-blue paper, covered with silvery fern-leaves, that Louis took suchpains to procure, and the china door-handles that he brought over inhis pockets, and the great map which Mary pasted over the obstinatespot of damp in the vestibule, were the occasions of the greatestblitheness and merriment that they shared together. Much did theyenjoy the prediction that James would not know his own house; greatlydid they delight in sowing surprises, and in obtaining AuntCatharine's never-failing start of well-pleased astonishment. Eachwedding present was an event;--Mr. Mansell's piano, whichdisconcerted all previous designs; Lord Ormersfield's handsome plate;and many a minor gift from old scholars, delighted to find anoccasion when an offering would not be an offence. Even Mr. Calcottgave a valuable inkstand, in which Mrs. Frost and Louis beheldsomething of forgiveness.Isabel had expressed a wish that Mary should be one of herbridesmaids. A wedding was not the scene which poor Mary wished towitness at present; but she saw Louis bent on having her with him,and would not vex him by reluctance. He had also prevailed on hisfather to be present, though the Earl was much afraid of establishinga precedent, and being asked to act the part of father on futurecontingencies. There was only one bride, as he told Louis, whom hecould ever wish to give away. However, that trouble was spared himby Mr. Mansell; but still Louis would not let him off, on the pleathat James's side of the house should make as imposing ademonstration as possible.Mrs. Frost was less manageable. Though warmly invited by theConways, and fondly entreated by her grandson, she shook her head,and said she was past those things, and that the old mother alwaysstayed at home to cook the wedding dinner. She should hear all whenClara came home the next day, and should be ready for the happy pairwhen they would return for Christmas, after a brief stay at ThorntonConway, which Isabel wished James to see, that he might share in allher old associations.All the rest of the party journeyed to London on a November day; and,in gaslight and gloom, they deposited Mary at her aunt's house inBryanston Square.Gaslight was the staple of Hymen's torch the next morning. Londonwas under one of the fogs, of which it is popularly said you may cutthem with a knife. The church was in dim twilight; the bride andbridegroom loomed through the haze, and the indistinctness madeClara's fine tall figure appear quite majestic above the heads of theother bridesmaids.The breakfast was by lamp-light, and the mist looked lurid and grimover the white cake, and no one talked of anything but thecomparative density of fogs; and Mr. Mansell's asthma had come on,and his speech was devolved upon Lord Ormersfield, to whom Louis hadimprudently promised exemption.What was worse, Lady Conway had paired them off in the order ofprecedence; and Louis was a victim to two dowagers, between whom hecould neither see nor speak to Mary. He was the more concerned,because he had thought her looking depressed and avoiding his eye.He tried to believe this caution, but he thought she was also eludingbis father, and her whole air gave him a vague uneasiness. The wholeparty were to dine with Lady Conway; and, trusting in the meantime todiscover what was on her spirits, be tried to resign himself to theorder of the day, without a farther glimpse of her.When the married pair took leave, Walter gave his sister a great hug,but had no perception of his office of handing her downstairs; and itwas Fitzjocelyn who gave her his arm, and put her into the carriage,with an augury that the weather would be beautiful when once they hadleft the fog in London.She smiled dreamily, and repeated, 'beautiful,' as though all were sobeautiful already to her that she did not so much as perceive thefog.James pressed his hand, saying, 'I am glad you are to be the one tobe happy next.''You do not look so,' said Clara, earnestly.The two sisters had come partly downstairs, but their London habitshad restrained them from following to the street-door, as Clara haddone; and now they had rushed up again, while Clara, with one foot onthe staircase, looked in her cousin's face, as he tried to smile inanswer, and repeated, 'Louis, I hoped you were quite happy.''I am,' said Louis, quickly.'Then why do you look so grave and uneasy?''Louis!' said an entreating voice above, and there stood Mary--'Praysay nothing, but call a cab for me, please. No, I am not ill-indeed, I am not--but I cannot stay!''You look ill! It has been too much for you! Clara, take her--lether lie down quietly,' cried Louis, springing to her side.'Oh no, thank you-no,' said Mary, decidedly, though very low; 'I toldLady Conway that I could not stay. I settled it with Aunt Melicent.''That aunt of yours--''Hush! No, it is for my own sake--my own doing. I cannot bear itany longer! Please let me go!''Then I will take you. I saw the brougham waiting. We will goquietly together.''No, that must not be.''I was thoughtless in urgtng you to come. The turmoil has been toomuch. My poor Mary! That is what comes of doing what I like insteadof what you like. Why don't you always have your own way? Let mecome; nay, if you will not, at least let Clara go with you, and comeback.'Mary roused herself at last to speak, as she moved downstairs--'Youneed not think of me; there is nothing the matter with me. Ipromised Aunt Melicent to come home. She is very kind--it is notthat.''You must not tell me not to think. I shall come to inquire. Ishall be with you the first thing tomorrow.''Yes, you must come to-morrow,' said Mary, in a tone he could notinterpret, and a tight lingering grasp on his hand, as he put herinto his father's carriage.He stood hesitating for a moment as it drove off; then, instead ofentering the house, walked off quickly in the same direction.Clara had stood all the time like a statue on the stairs, waiting tosee if she were wanted, and gazing intently, with her fingersclasped. When both were gone she drew a long breath, and nodded withher head, whispering to herself, in a grave and critical voice--'Thatis love!'She did not see Fitzjocelyn again till nearly dinner-time; and, as hecaught her anxious interrogating eye, he came to her and said, verylow, 'I was not let in; Miss Ponsonby was engaged. Miss Mary lyingdown--I believe they never told her I was there.''It is all that aunt--horrid woman!''Don't talk of it now. I _will_ see her to-morrow.'Clara grieved for him whenever she saw him called on to exert himselfto talk; and she even guarded him from the sallies of his youngcousins. Once, when much music and talk was going on, he came andsat by her, and made her tell him how fondly and affectionately shehad parted with her schoolfellows; and how some of her old foes hadbecome, as she hoped, friends for life; but she saw his eye fixed andabsent even while she spoke, and she left off suddenly. 'Go on,' hesaid, 'I like to hear;' and with a manifest effort he bent his mindto attend.'Oh!' thought Clara, as she went up that night--'why will the daysone most expects to be happy turn out so much otherwise? However, hewill manage to tell me all about it when he and his father take mehome to-morrow.'CHAPTER IV.OUTWARD BOUND. The voice which I did more esteem Than music in her sweetest key-- Those eyes which unto me did seem More comfortable than the day-- Those now by me, as they have been, Shall never more be heard or seen. GEORGE WITHER.In suspense and impatience, Fitzjocelyn awaited the end of hisfather's breakfast, that he might hasten to learn what ailed Mary.The post came in, vexing him at first merely as an additional delay,but presently a sound of dissatisfaction attracted his notice to theforeign air of two envelopes which had been forwarded from home.'Hem!' said the Earl, gravely, 'I am afraid this fellow Ponsonby willgive us some trouble.''Then Mary had heard from him!' cried Louis. 'She was keeping itfrom me, not to spoil the day. I must go to her this moment--'butpausing again, 'What is it? He cannot have had my letter!''No, but he seems to have anticipated it. Puffed up as they areabout these speculations, he imagines me to have brought Mary homefor no purpose but to repair our fortunes; and informs me that, inthe event of your marriage, she will receive not a farthing beyondher mother's settlements. I am much obliged! It is all I everthought you would receive; and but for me, it would have been in thebottom of some mine long ago! Do you wish to see what he says?'Louis caught up the missive. It was the letter of a very angry man,too violent to retain the cold formality which he tried to assume.'He was beholden to his lordship for his solicitude about hisdaughter. It was of a piece with other assistance formerly renderedto him in his domestic arrangements, for which he was equallyobliged. He was happy to inform his lordship that, in this instance,his precautions had been uncalled for; and referred him to a letterwhich he would receive from Mr. Dynevor by the same mail, for anexplanation of the circumstances to which he referred. He had beeninformed, by undoubted authority, that Lord Fitzjocelyn had done hisdaughter the honour of soliciting her hand. It might console hislordship to learn that, should the union take place, the whole of hisproperty would be secured to Mrs. Ponsonby, and his daughter's solefortune would be that which she inherited by her mother's marriagesettlements. Possibly this intelligence might lead to a cessation ofthese flattering attentions.''Mrs. Ponsonby! he can mention her in the same sentence with Mary'smother!' said the Earl.Louis turned pale as he read, and scarcely breathed as he looked upat his father, dreading that he might so resent the studied affrontsas to wish to break off the connexion, and that he might have himlikewise to contend with; but on that score he was set at rest. TheEarl replied to his exclamation of angry dismay, 'It is little morethan I looked for. It is not the first letter I have had from him.I find he has some just cause for offence. The marriage is lessdisgraceful than I had been led to believe. Here is Oliver Dynevor'stestimony.'Oliver Dynevor's was a succinct business-like letter, certifying hiscousin that he had been mistaken in his view of the marriage. DonaRosita de Guzman was an orphan of a very respectable family, who hadcome to spend the year before her intended noviciate at the house ofan uncle. She was very young, and Mr. Dynevor believed that themarriage had been hastened by her relations making her feel herselfunwelcome, and her own reluctance to return to her convent, and thatshe might not be aware how very recently Mr. Ponsonby had become awidower. For his own part, he was little used to ladies' society,and could form no judgment of the bride; but he could assure LordOrmersfield that she had been guilty of no impropriety; she wasvisited by every one; and that there was no reason against MaryPonsonby associating with her.'What could the clerk be thinking of?' exclaimed Louis.'My first impression was not taken from the clerk. What I heardfirst, and in the strongest terms, was from the captain of a ship atValparaiso. In fact, it was in the mouth of all who had known thefamily. Robson neither confirmed nor contradicted, and gave me thenotion of withholding much from regard for his employer. He lamentedthe precipitation, but seemed willing to make excuses. He distinctlysaid, he would not take it on himself to recommend Miss Ponsonby'scontinuing her journey. He was right. If I had known all this, Ishould still have brought her home. I must write an apology, as faras her character is concerned; but, be that as it may, the marriageis atrocious--an insult--a disgrace! He could not have waited sixweeks--''But I must go to Mary!' cried Louis, as though reproaching himselffor the delay. 'Oh! that she should have forced herself to thatwedding, and spared me!''I am coming with you,' said the Earl. 'She will require my personalassurance that all this makes no difference to me.''I am more afraid of the difference it may make to her,' said Louis.'You have never believed how fond she is of her father.'On arriving, they were ushered into the room where Miss Ponsonby wasat breakfast, and a cup of tea and untasted roll showed where herniece had been. She received them with stiff, upright chillness; andto their hope that Mary was not unwell, replied--'Not very well. Shehad been over-fatigued yesterday, and had followed her advice ingoing to lie down.'Louis began to imagine a determination to exclude him, and waseagerly beginning to say that she had asked him to come that morning--could she not see him? when the lady continued, with the sameseverity--'Until yesterday, I was not aware how much concern LordFitzjocelyn had taken in what related to my niece.'At that moment, when Louis's face was crimson with confusion andimpatience, the door was softly pushed ajar, and he heard himselfcalled in low, hoarse tones. Miss Ponsonby was rising with an air ofvexed surprise, but he never saw her, and, hastily crossing the room,he shut the door behind him, and followed the form that flitted upthe stairs so fast, that he did not come up with her till she hadentered the drawing-room, and stood leaning against a chair to gatherbreath. She was very pale, and her eyes looked as if she had criedall night, but she controlled her voice to say, 'I could not bearthat you should hear it from Aunt Melicent.''We had letters this morning, dearest. Always thinking for me! ButI must think for you. You can hardly stand--'He would have supported her to the sofa, but she shrank from him;and, leaning more heavily on the chair, said--'Do you not know,Louis, all that must be at an end?''I know no such thing. My father is here on purpose to assure youthat it makes not the slightest difference to him.''Yours! Yes! But oh, Louis!' with a voice that, in its faintnessand steadiness, had a sound of anguish--'only think what I allowedhim to make me do! To insult my father and his choice! It was amistake, I know,' she continued, fearing to be unjust and to grieveLouis; 'but a most dreadful one!''He says he should have brought you home all the same--' began Louis.'Mary, you must sit down!' he cried, interrupting himself to comenearer; and she obeyed, sinking into the chair. 'What a state youare in! How could you go through yesterday? How could you bedistressed, and not let me know?''I could not spoil their wedding-day, that we had wished for solong.''Then you had the letter?''In the morning. Oh, that I had examined farther! Oh, that I hadnever come home!''Mary! I cannot hear you say so.''You would have been spared all this. You were doing very wellwithout me--as you will--'He cried out with deprecating horror.'Louis!' she said, imploringly. 'Oh, Louis! do not make it harderfor me to do right.''Why--what? I don't understand! Your father has not so much asheard how we stand together. He cannot be desiring you to give meup.''He--he forbids me to enter on anything of the sort with you. Idon't know what made him think it possible, but he does. And--'again Mary waited for the power of utterance, 'he orders me to comeout with Mrs. Willis, in the Valdivia, and it sails on the 12th ofDecember!''But Mary, Mary! you cannot be bound by this. It is only fairtowards him, towards all of us, to give him time to answer ourletters.'Mary shook her head. 'The only condition, he says, on which he couldallow me to remain, would be if I were engaged to James Frost.''Too late for that, certainly,' said Louis; and the smile was arelief to both. 'At any rate, it shows that he can spare you. Onlygive him time. When he has my father's explanation--and my father iscertain to be so concerned at having cast any imputation on a lady.His first thought was to apologize--''That is not all! I remember now that dear mamma always said she didnot know whether he would consent. Oh! how weak I was ever tolisten--''No, Mary, that must not be said. It was my presumptuous, inveteratefolly that prevented you from trusting my affection when she mighthave helped us.''I don't know. It would have caused her anxiety and distress whenshe was in no state for them. I don't think it did,' said Mary,considering; 'I don't think she ever knew how much I cared.'The admission could only do Louis's heart good, and he recurred tohis arguments that her father could be persuaded by such a letter ashe felt it in him to write.'You do not know all,' said Mary. 'I could not show you his letter;but, from it and from my aunt, I better understand what impressionshe has of you all, and how hopeless it is.''Tell me!'She could not help giving herself the relief, when that most loving,sympathizing face was pleading with her to let him comfort her. Sheknew there was no fiery nor rancorous temper to take umbrage, and itwas best for him to know the completeness of the death-blow.'Oh, Louis! he fancies that my dear mother's fondness for her ownfamily destroyed his domestic peace. He says their pride and narrownotions poisoned--yes, that is the word--poisoned her mind againsthim; and that was the reason he insisted on my being brought up here,and kept from you all.''But I don't understand why he let you come straight home to us, andlive in Dynevor Terrace?''Then he was really sorry mamma was so ill; and--and for all that waspast; I am sure he felt it was the last parting, and only wished todo anything that could make up to her. He freely gave her leave togo wherever she pleased, and said not a word against Northwold. Itwas one of her great comforts that he never seemed in the least vexedat anything she had done since we went home. Besides, my aunt saysthat he and Mr. Dynevor had some plans about James and me.''He will have that out of his head. He will come to reason. Fond ofyou, and sorry for the past, he will listen. No wonder he was in apassion; but just imagine what it would be to heed half Jem Frostsays when he is well worked up!''Papa is not like James,' said Mary; 'things go deeper with him. Henever forgets! I shall never forgive myself for not having spoken toRobson! I know his manner, seeming to assent and never committinghimself, and I ought to have gone through anything rather than havetaken such an accusation for granted.'To hinder his pleading against her self-conviction, she re-opened herletter to prove the cruelty of the injustice. Mr. Ponsonby professedto have been unwilling to enter so speedily on the new tie; but tohave been compelled, by the species of persecution which wasexercised on Rosita, in order to make her return to her nunnery. Hedwelt on her timid affection and simplicity, and her exceedingmortification at the slur which Mary had been induced to cast uponher; though, he said, her innocent mind could not comprehend the fullextent of the injury; since the step his daughter had taken would,when known, seriously affect the lady's reception into society, in amanner only to be repaired by Mary's immediately joining them atLima. He peremptorily indicated the ship and the escort--amerchant's wife, well known to her and charged her, on her duty, asthe only proof of obedience or affection which could remedy the past,to allow no influence nor consideration whatever to detain her. 'Yousee?' said Mary.'I see!' was the answer. 'Mary, you are right, you must go.'The words restored her confiding look, and her face lost almost allthe restless wretchedness which had so transformed it. 'Thank you,'she said, with a long breath; 'I knew you would see it so.''It will be a very pretty new style of wedding tour. Andes for Alps!No, Mary, you need not suspect me of trifling now! I really mean it,and, seriously, our going in that way would set this Rosita straightwith society much more handsomely and effectually. Don't doubt myfather--I will fetch him.''Stop, Louis! You forget! Did I not tell you that he expresslywarns me against you? He must have heard of what happened before: hesays I had prudence once to withstand, and he trusts to my spirit anddiscretion to--' Mary stopped short of the phrase before her eyes--toresist the interested solicitations of necessitous nobility, and theallurements of a beggarly coronet. 'No,' she concluded; 'he saysthat you are the last person whom he could think of allowing me toaccept.' She hid her face in her hands, and her voice died away.'Happily that is done,' said Louis, not yet disconcerted; 'but if yougo, as I own you must, it shall be with a letter of mine, explainingall. You will plead for me--I think you will, and when he issatisfied that we are no rebels, then the first ship that sails forPeru--Say that will do, Mary.''No, Louis, I know my father.' She roused herself and sat upright,speaking resolutely, but not daring to look at him--'I made up mymind last night. It was weak and selfish in me to enter into thisengagement, and it must be broken off. You must be left free--notbound for years and years.''Oh, Mary! Mary! this is too much. I deserved distrust by mywretched folly and fickleness last year, but I did not know what youwere to me then--my most precious one! Can you not trust me! Do younot know how I would wait?''You would wait,' said poor Mary, striving with choking tears, 'andbe sorry you had waited.''Are you talking madness, Mary? I should live for the moment tocompensate for all.''You would waste your best years, and when the time came, you wouldstill be young, and I grown into an old careworn woman. You wouldfind you had waited for what was nothing worth!''How can you talk so!' cried Louis, wounded, 'when you know that tocherish and make up to you would be my dearest, fondest wish! No,don't shake your head! You know it is not a young rose and lilybeauty that I love,--it is the honest, earnest glance in my Mary'seyes, the rest, and trust, and peace, whenever I do but come nearher. Time can't take that away!''Pray,' said Mary, feebly, 'don't let us discuss it now. I know itis right. I was determined to say it to-day, that the worst might beover, but I can't argue, nor bear your kindness now. Please let itwait.''Yes, let it wait. It is depression. You will see it in a truelight when you have recovered the shock, and don't fancy all must begiven up together. Lie down and rest; I am sure you have been awakeall night.''I may rest now I have told you, and seen you not angry with poorpapa, nor with me. Oh! Louis--the gratitude to you, the weight offmy mind!''I don't think any one could help taking the same view,' said Louis.'It seems to me one of the cases where the immediate duty is the moreclear because it is so very painful. Mary, I think that you arecommitting your way unto the Lord, and you know 'He shall bring it topass.''As he spoke there was a tap at the door, and Miss Ponsonby, stifflyentering, said, 'Excuse my interruption, but I hope Lord Fitzjocelynwill be considerate enough not to harass you any longer withsolicitations to act against your conscience.''He is not persuading me,' said Mary, turning towards her aunt a facewhich, through all her dejection, proved her peace in his support andapproval, 'he is helping me.''Yes,' said Louis to the astonished aunt; 'since I have heard thetrue state of the case, I have been convinced that there is no choicefor her but to go out, to repair the injustice so unfortunately doneto this poor lady. It is a noble resolution, and I perfectly concurwith her.''I am glad you think so properly, sir,' returned Miss Ponsonby.'Lord Ormersfield seems quite of another opinion. He was desirous ofseeing you, Mary; but I have been telling him I could permit no moreinterviews to-day.''Oh no,' said Mary, putting her hand to her head, as if it could bearno more; 'not to-day! Louis, tell him how it is. Make him forgiveme; but do not let me see him yet.''You shall see no one,' said Louis, tenderly; 'you shall rest.There--' and, as if he had the sole right to her, he arranged thecushions, placed her on the sofa, and hung over her to chafe herhands, and bathe her forehead with eau de Cologne; while, as hedetected signs of hasty preparations about the room, he added, 'Don'ttrouble yourself with your arrangements; I will see about all I canto help you. Only rest, and cure your head.''Say that one thing to me again,' whispered Mary, ere letting hishand go.Again he murmured the words, 'Commit thy way unto the Lord, and Heshall bring it to pass.'Then Mary felt her hand pressed to his lips, but she would notunclose her burning eyes; she would fain sleep beneath the impress ofthat spell of patient confidence.The gentle authority of his manner had deprived Miss Ponsonby of allnotion of interfering. This 'odious, frivolous young man offashion,' so entirely disconcerted her ideas of ardent lovers, or ofself-interested puppies, that she gazed at him, surprised andsoftened; and when he looked at her anxiously, to judge whether Marywould find in her a kind comforter, her eyes were full of tears, andshe said as they left the room, 'It must be a great relief to my poorMary that you see it so sensibly. She has been suffering much inanticipation of this meeting.''Her unselfishness goes to one's heart!' said Louis, almost overcome.'If she would but have spared herself yesterday!''Ah! she said she could not bear that you should be pained on yourfriend's wedding-day. I am much comforted to find that youappreciate the effort.'This was not what Miss Ponsonby had intended to say, but there wassomething about the young man that touched her exceedingly; even whenfresh from a very civil and decorous combat with his father, and aripping-up of all the ancient grievances of the married life of theirtwo relations, rendering wider than ever the breach between thehouses of Ponsonby and Fitzjocelyn.Lord Ormersfield came forward to learn whether he might see Mary, andwas met by assurances that she must be kept as quiet as possible;upon which he took leave, making a stately bend of the head, whileLouis shook Miss Ponsonby's hand, and said he should come to the doorto inquire before the day was over.'I never saw her so broken down,' he said, in answer to his father'scompassionate but indignant exclamation as they walked home.'Yesterday was a terrible strain on her.''I wish we had never brought her here,' said Lord Ormersfield. 'Theaunt is your enemy, as she always was that of Mary's mother. Shenearly avowed that she set her brother on making this prematureprohibition.''I do not think she is unkind to Mary,' said Louis; 'I could bealmost glad that the dear Aunt Kitty is spared all this worry. Itwould make her so very miserable.''Her influence would be in your favour, whereas this woman isperfectly unreasonable. She justifies her brother in everything, andis actually working on that poor girl's scruples of conscience tosend her out by this ship.''Nay,' said Louis, 'after hearing her father's letter, I do not seethat it is possible for her to do otherwise.'Lord Ormersfield hastily turned to look at his son's countenance,--itwas flushed and melancholy, but fully in earnest; nevertheless theEarl would not believe his ears, and made a sound as if he had missedthe words.'I am grieved enough to say so,' repeated Louis; 'but, as he puts it,I do not see how Mary can refuse to obey him.''I declare, Fitzjocelyn,' exclaimed his father, with some anger, 'anyone who takes the trouble, may talk you into anything imaginable!''Not into believing her wrong.''I did not think you so weak!' continued his father. 'It is the verycase where a woman's exaggerated notions of right may be wrought onto do her infinite harm! They become quite ridiculous without someone to show that such things may be carried too far! I must say, Idid expect strength of mind and common sense for your own interest.I esteem it a mere matter of duty to put an end to such nonsense.''My dear father,' said Louis, 'it was Mary and her mother who firsttaught me my own obligations. I should never dare to interfere withany one's filial duty--above all, where my own happiness is so deeplyconcerned.''Yours! I am not talking of yours. What is to become of Mary withsuch a man as that? and this Spanish woman, who, if she does notdeserve all that has been said of her, no doubt soon will?--noeducation, no principles, breaking out of her convent! And you letyourself be drawn into calling it Mary's duty to run into suchcompany as that! You are not fit to protect her.''From all I have heard of Mr. Ponsonby, I am convinced he has toomuch regard for his daughter to summon her into any improper society.I do not hear that he has been to blame as a father. I wish I couldsee it as you do; but not only do I know that Mary could not have aninstant's peace under the sense of his displeasure, but it seems tome that this is one of the express commands which could not bedisobeyed without setting aside the law of Heaven. If I gave myvoice against it, I should fear to bring on us a curse, and not ablessing.''Fitzjocelyn, I always knew how it would be if you took to being oneof those very good people. Nothing is so weak, and yet sounmanageable. Any rational being would look on it as a duty torescue her from such a man as that; but that is too ordinary a virtuefor you. You must go higher.'Louis made no answer. Never had his father pained him so much, andhe could ill brook additional suffering.'However,' said the Earl, recovering, 'I shall see her. I shall putthe matter in a just light. She is a sensible girl, and willunderstand me when she has recovered the shock. On one head I shallgive warning. She must choose between us and her father. If shepersist in going out to join this establishment, I will have yourengagement given up.''Father! father! you would not be so cruel!''I know what I am saying. Am I to allow you to be encumbered all thetime she is on the other side of the world, waiting Ponsonby'spleasure, to come home at last, in ten or fifteen years' time,worried and fretted to death, like her poor mother? No, Louis, itmust be now or never.''You are only saying what I would not hear from her. She has beeninsisting on breaking off, and all my hope was in you.''She has? That is like her! The only reasonable thing I have heardyet.''Then you will not help me? You, who I thought loved her like yourown daughter, and wished for nothing so much!''So I might; but that is a different thing from allowing you to wearout your life in a hopeless engagement. If she cast off her family,nothing could be better, otherwise, I would never connect you withthem.'It did not occur to his lordship that he was straining pretty hardthe filial duty of his own son, while he was arguing that Mary shouldsnap asunder the same towards her father.The fresh discomfiture made poor Louis feel utterly dejected andalmost hopeless, but lest silence should seem to consent, he said,'When you see Mary, you will be willing for me to do anything ratherthan lose what is so dear and so noble.''Yes, I will see Mary. We will settle it between us, and have itright yet; but we must give her to-day to think it over, and get overthe first shock. When she has had a little time for reflection, afew cool arguments from me will bring her to reason.'So it was all to be settled over Louis's passive head; and thussatisfied, his father, who was exceedingly sorry for him, forgot hisanger, and offered to go home alone as Clara's escort, promising toreturn on the Monday, to bring the full force of his remonstrances tobear down Mary's scruples.Lord Ormersfield believed Clara too much of a child to have any ideason what was passing; and had it depended on him, she must have gonehome in an agony of ignorance on the cause of her cousin's trouble,but Louis came with them to the station, and contrived to say to herwhile walking up and down the platform, 'Her father is bitter againstme. He has sent for her, and she is going!'Clara looked mutely in his face, with a sort of inquiring dismay.'You'll hear all about it when my father has told Aunt Kitty,' saidLouis. 'Clara,'--he paused, and spoke lower--'tell her I see what isright now; tell her to--to pray for me, that I may not be talked intotampering with my conscience or with hers. Don't let it dwell on youor on my aunt,' he added, cheerfully. 'No, it won't; you will bethinking of Jem and Isabel.' And as his father came up, his lastwords were, in his own bright tone, 'Tell granny from me thatgiraffes ought always to be seen by gaslight.'Clara's countenance returned him a look of sorrowful reproach, forthinking her capable of being amused when he was in distress; andshe sat in silent musings all the way home--pondering over his words,speculating on his future, wondering what Mary felt, and becomingblunt and almost angry, when her grave escort in the opposite cornerconsulted civility by addressing some indifferent remark to her, asif, she said to herself, 'she were no better than a stuffed giraffe,and knew and cared nothing about anybody!'He might have guessed that she understood something by the sudden wayin which she curtailed her grandmother's rapturous and affectionateinquiries about the wedding, ran upstairs on the plea of taking offher bonnet, and appeared no more till he had gone home; when, comingdown, she found granny, with tearful eyes, lamenting that Mr.Ponsonby was so harsh and unkind, and fully possessed with therational view which her nephew had been impressing on her.'Ha!' said Clara, 'that is what Louis meant. I'll tell you what,granny, Lord Ormersfield never knew in his life what was right, halfas well as Louis does. I wish he would let him alone. If Mary isgood enough for him, she will go out and wait till her father comesround. If she is not, she won't; and Lord Ormersfield has nobusiness to tease her.''Then you would like her to go out?' said Mrs. Frost.'I like anything that makes Louis happy. I thought it would havebeen delightful to have him married--one could be so much more atOrmersfield, and Mary would be so nice; but as to their being over-persuaded, and thinking themselves half wrong! why, they would neverbe happy in their lives; and Louis would be always half-asleep orhalf mad, to save himself the trouble of thinking. But he'll neverdo it!'On the Saturday morning Mary's healthy and vigorous spirit had quiteresumed its tone. The worst was over when she had inflicted thestroke on Louis, and seen him ready to support instead of adding toher distress. He found her pale and sorrowful, but calm, collected,and ready for exertion. By tacit consent, they avoided alldiscussion of the terms on which they were to stand. Greatly touchedby her consideration for him on the wedding-day, he would not tortureher with pleadings, and was only too grateful for every service thathe was allowed to render her without protest, as still her chief andmost natural dependence.She did not scruple to allow him to assist her; she understood thegratification to him, and it was only too sweet to her to be stillhis object. She could trust him not to presume, his approval madeher almost happy; and yet it was hard that his very patience andacquiescence should endear him so much as to render the parting somuch the more painful. The day was spent in business. Hefacilitated much that would have been arduous for two solitary women,and did little all day but go about for Mary, fulfilling thecommissions which her father had sent home; and though he did it witha sore heart, it was still a privilege to be at work for Mary.Rigid as Miss Ponsonby was, she began to be touched. There was adoubt as to his admission when he came on Sunday morning--'Mistresssaw no one on Sunday,' but when his name was carried in, MissPonsonby could not withstand Mary's face. She took care to tell himher rule; but that, considering the circumstances, she had made anexception in his favour, on the understanding that nothing was tobreak in upon the observance of the Sabbath.Louis bent his head, with the heartfelt answer that he was but tooglad to be permitted to go to church once more with Mary.Aunt Melicent's Sunday was not quite their own Sunday, but all thatthey could desire was to be quietly together, and restricted from allthose agitating topics and arrangements. It was a day of rest, andthey valued it accordingly. In fact, Miss Ponsonby found the youngLord so good and inoffensive, that she broke her morning'sresolution, invited him to partake of the cold dinner, let him go tochurch with them again in the evening, and remain to tea; and when hetook leave, she expressed such surprised admiration at his havingcome and gone on his own feet, his church-going, and his conductgenerally, that Mary could not help suspecting that her good aunt hadsupposed that he had never heard of the Fourth Commandment.Miss Ponsonby was one of the many good women given to hard judgmentson slight grounds, and to sudden reactions still more violent; andthe sight of Lord Fitzjocelyn spending a quiet, respectable Sunday,had such an effect on her, that she transgressed her own mandate, andbroached 'the distressing subject.''Mary, my dear, I suppose this young gentleman is an improvedcharacter?''He is always improving,' said Mary.'I mean, that an important change must have taken place since Iunderstood you to say you had refused him. I thought you acted mostproperly then; and, as I see him now, I think you equally right inaccepting him.''He was very much what he is now,' said Mary.'Then it was from no doubt of his being a serious character?''None whatever,' said Mary, emphatically.'Well, my dear, I must confess his appearance, his family, and yourrefusal, misled me. I fear I did him great injustice.'A silence, and then Miss Ponsonby said, 'After all, my dear, though Ithought quite otherwise at first, I do believe that, considering whatthe youth is, and how much attached he seems, you might safelycontinue the engagement.'Mary's heart glowed to her aunt for having been thus conquered byLouis--she who, three nights back, had been so severely incredulous,so deeply disappointed in her niece for having been deluded intoendurance of him. But her resolution was fixed. 'It would not beright,' she said; 'his father would not allow it. There is so littlechance of papa's relenting, or of my coming home, that it would bewrong to keep him in suspense. He had better turn his thoughtselsewhere while he is young enough to begin again.''It might save him from marrying some mere fine lady.''That will never be, whatever woman he chooses will--' She could notgo on, but presently cleared her voice--'No; I should like to leavehim quite free. I was less his choice than his father's; and, thoughI thought we should have been very happy, it does not seem to be theleading of Heaven. I am so far his inferior in cleverness, andeverything attractive, and have been made so like his elder sister,that it might not have been best for him. I want him to feel that,in beginning afresh, he is doing me no injury; and then in time,whenever I come home, it may be such a friendship as there wasbetween our elders. That is what I try to look forward to,--no, Idon't think I look forward to anything. Good night, Aunt Melicent--I am so glad you like him!'In this mind Mary met Lord Ormersfield. The delay had been anadvantage, for he was less irritated, and she had regained self-possession. Her passage had been taken, and this was an argumentthat told on the Earl, though he refused to call it irrevocable. Hefound that there was no staggering her on the score of the life thatawaited her; she knew more on that subject than he did, hadconfidence in her father, and no dread of Rosita; and she was toomuch ashamed and grieved at the former effect of his persuasions toattend to any more of a like description. He found her sense of dutymore stubborn than he had anticipated, and soon had no more to say.She might carry it too far; but the principle was sound, and a fathercould not well controvert it. He had designed the rupture with Louisas a penalty to drive her into his measures; but he could not sopropound it, and was wondering how to bring it in, when Mary relievedhim by beginning herself, and stating the grounds with such sensible,unselfish, almost motherly care of Louis's happiness, that he wasmore unwilling than ever to let him resign her, and was on the pointof begging her to re-consider, and let Louis wait for ever ratherthan lose her. But he knew they ought not to be bound, under suchuncertainties, and his conviction was too strong to give way toemotion. He thanked her, and praised her with unwonted agitation,and regretted more than ever; and so they closed the conference bydeciding that, unless Mr. Ponsonby should be induced to relent by hisdaughter's representations on her arrival, Mary and Louis mustconsider themselves as mutually released.That loophole--forlorn, most forlorn hope, as they knew it to be--wasan infinite solace to the young people, by sparing them a formalparting, and permitting them still to feel that they belonged to eachother. If he began declaring that nothing would ever make him feeldisconnected with Mary, he was told that it was not time to think ofthat, and they must not waste their time. And once Mary reminded himhow much worse it would be if they had been separated by a quarrel.'Anger might give one spirits,' he said, smiling mournfully.'At the time; but think what it would be not to be able to rememberhappy times without remorse.''Then you do mean to recollect, Mary?''I trust to bring myself to remember rightly and wisely. I shall tryto set it for a reward for myself to cure me of repinings,' saidMary, looking into his face, as if the remembrance of it must bringcheerfulness and refreshment.'And when shall I not think, Mary! When I leave off work, I shallwant you for a companion; when I go to work, the thought must stir meup. Your judgment must try my own.''Oh, hush, Louis! this is not good. Be yourself, and be more thanyourself, and only think of the past as a time when we had a greatdeal of pleasantness, and you did me much good.''Did I?''Yes; I see it now I am with Aunt Melicent. You put so many morethoughts in my head, and showed me that so much more was good andwholesome than I used to fancy. Dear mamma once said you wereeducating me; and I hope to go on, and not let your lessons wasteaway.''Nay, Mary, you won good everywhere. If you had not been Mary, Imight have made you a great goose. But you taught me all theperseverance I ever had. And oh! Mary, I don't wonder you do nottrust it.''There is the forbidden subject,' said Mary, firmly.That was the sort of conversation into which they fell now and thenduring those last days of busy sadness.Truly it could have been worse. Suffering by their own fault wouldhave rent them asunder more harshly, and Louis's freedom from allfierceness and violence softened all ineffably to Mary. JamesFrost's letter of fiery indignation, almost of denunciation, made herthankful that he was not the party concerned; and Louis made hersmile at Isabel's copy of all his sentiments in ladylike phrases.The last day came. Louis would not be denied seeing Mary on boardthe Valdivia; and, in spite of all Miss Ponsonby's horror ofrailways, he persuaded her to trust herself under his care toLiverpool. She augured great things from the letter which she hadentrusted to Mary, and in which she had spoken of Lord Fitzjocelyn inthe highest terms her vocabulary could furnish.They parted bravely. Spectators hindered all display of feeling, andno one cried, except Miss Ponsonby.'Good-bye, Louis; I will not forget your messages to Tom Madison. Mylove to your father and Aunt Catharine.''Good-bye, Mary; I shall see Tom and Chimborazo yet.'CHAPTER V.THE NEW WORLD. Still onward, as to southern skies, We spread our sails, new stars arise, New lights upon the glancing tide, Fresh hues where pearl and coral hide: What are they all but tokens true Of grace for ever fresh and new! Prayers for Emigrants.There are some days in the early year, devoid indeed of springbrilliance, but full of soft, heavy, steaming fragrance, pervadingthe grey air with sweet odours, and fostering the growth of tenderbud and fragile stem with an unseen influence, more mild and kindlythan even the smiling sunbeam or the gushing shower. 'A growingday,' as the country-people term such genial, gentle weather, mightnot be without analogy to the brief betrothal of Louis and Mary.Subdued and anxious, there had been little of the ordinary light ofjoy, hope, or gaiety, and their pleasures had been less their ownthan in preparing the happiness of their two friends. It was a timesuch as to be more sweet in memory than it was in the present; andthe shade which had hung over it, the self-restraint and theforbearance which it had elicited, had unconsciously conduced to thedevelopment of the characters of both, preparing them to endure theparting far more effectually than unmixed enjoyment could have done.The check upon Louis's love of trifling, the restraint on hisspirits, the being thrown back on his own judgment when he wanted tolean upon Mary, had given him a habit of controlling his boyish ways.It was a call to train himself in manliness and self-reliance. Itchanged him from the unstable reed he once had been, and helped himto take one steady and consistent view of the trial required of himand of Mary, and then to act upon it resolutely and submissively.With Mary gone, he cared little what became of him until her letterscould arrive; and his father, with more attention to his supposedbenefit than to his wishes, carried him at once, without returninghome, to a round of visits among all his acquaintance most likely tofurnish a distracting amount of Christmas gaieties. In the midst ofthese, there occurred a vacancy in the representation of a boroughchiefly under the influence of Sir Miles Oakstead; and, as it wasconsidered expedient that he should be brought into Parliament, hisfather repaired with him at once to Oakstead, and involved him in allthe business of the election. On his success, he went with hisfather to London for the session, and this was all that his friendsat Northwold knew of him. He wrote hurried notes to James or to Mr.Holdsworth on necessary affairs connected with his farm andimprovements, mentioning facts instead of feelings, and promising towrite to Aunt Catharine when he should have time; but the time didnot seem to come, and it was easy to believe that his passiveness ofwill, increased by the recent stroke, had caused him to be hurriedinto a condition of involuntary practical activity.Mary, meanwhile, was retracing her voyage, in the lull of spiritswhich, after long straining, had nothing to do but to wait inpatience, bracing themselves for a fresh trial. Never sufferingherself, at sea, her first feelings, after the final wrench ofparting, were interrupted by the necessity of attending to herfriend, a young mother, with children enough to require all theservices that the indefatigable Mary could perform. If Mrs. Willisalways averred that she never could have gone through the voyagewithout Miss Ponsonby, Mary felt, in return, that the little fretfulboy and girl, who would never let her sit and think, except when bothwere asleep, had been no small blessing to her.Yet Mary was not so much absorbed and satisfied with the visible andpractical as had once been the case. The growth had not been all onLouis's side. If her steadfast spirit had strengthened his waveringresolution, the intercourse and sympathy with him had opened andunfolded many a perception and quality in her, which had been astightly and hardly cased up as leaf-buds in their gummy envelopes. Awider range had been given to her thoughts; there was a swelling ofheart, a vividness of sensation, such as she had not known in earliertimes; she had been taught the mystery of creation, the strangeconnexion with the Unseen, and even with her fellow-men. Beyond theordinary practical kind offices, for which she had been always ready,there was now mingled something of Louis's more comprehensive spiritof questioning what would do them good, and drawing food forreflection from their diverse ways.She was sensible of the change again and again, when sights recurredwhich once had only spoken to her eye. That luminous sea, sparklinglike floods of stars, had been little more than 'How pretty! howfunny!' at her first voyage. Now, it was not only 'How Louis wouldadmire it!' but 'How profusely, how gloriously has the Creator spreadthe globe with mysterious beauty! how marvellously has He caused Hiscreatures to hold forth this light, to attract others to theirneedful food!' And the furrow of fire left by their vessel's wakespoke to her of that path 'like a shining light, shining more andmore unto the perfect day.' If with it came the remembrance of hisvision of the threads of light, it was not a recollection which wouldlead to repining.And when at Cape Horn, a mighty ice mountain drifted within view,spired, pinnacled, encrusted with whiteness, rivalled only by theglory of the summer cloud, caverned here and there into hollows ofsapphire blue, too deeply dazzling to behold, or rising into peaks ofclear, hard, chill green; the wild fantastic points sometimesglimmering with fragments of the rainbow arch; the rich variety,endless beyond measure in form and colouring, and not onlymagnificent and terrible in the whole maas, but lovely beyondimagination in each crystal too minute for the eye. Mary had once,on a like occasion, only said, 'it was very cold;' and looked to seewhether the captain expected the monster to bear down on the ship.But the present iceberg put her in mind of the sublime aspirationswhich gothic cathedrals seem as if they would fain embody. And then,she thought of the marvellous interminable waste of beauty of thoseuntrodden regions, whence yonder enormous iceberg was but a smallfragment--a petty messenger--regions unseen by human eye--beautyuntouched by human hand-the glory, the sameness, yet the infinitevariety of perfect purity. Did it not seem, with all theassociations of cold, of peril, of dreariness, to be a visible tokenthat indeed He who fashioned it could prepare 'good things past man'sunderstanding!'It was well for Mary that southern constellations, snowy, white-winged albatross, leaping flying-fish, and white-capped mountain-coast, had been joined in her mind with something higher, deeper, andless personal, or their recurrence would have brought her nothing butpain unmitigated in the contrast with the time when first she hadbeheld them six years ago.Then she was full of hope and eager ardour to arrive, longing for theparental presence of which she had so long been deprived, hailingevery novel scene as a proof that she was nearer home, and withoutthe anticipation of one cloud, only expecting to be loved, to love,and to be useful. And now, all fond illusions as to her father hadbeen snatched away, her very love for him rendering the perceptiondoubly cruel; her mother, her precious mother, far away inOrmersfield churchyard--her life probably shortened by his harshness--her place occupied by a young girl, differing in language, inChurch, in everything--Mary's own pardon uncertain, after all heraacrifices--A sense of having deeply offended, hung upon her; andher heart was so entirely in England, that had her home been perfect,her voyage must still have been a cruel effort. That oneanticipation of being set at rest by her father's forgiveness, andthe forlorn despairing hope of his relenting towards Louis, were allshe dared to dwell on; and when Mrs. Willis counted the days till shecould arrive and meet her husband, poor Mary felt as if, but forthese two chances of comfort, she could gladly have prolonged thevoyage for the rest of her life.But one burning tropical noon, the Valdivia was entering Callaoharbour, and Mary, sick and faint at heart, was arraying herself in acoloured dress, lest her mourning should seem to upbraid her father.The voyage was over, the ship was anchored, boats were comingoffshore, the luggage was being hoisted out of the hold, thepassengers were congregated on deck, eager to land, some gazing withcurious and enterprising eyes on the new country, others scanningevery boat in hopes of meeting a familiar face. Mrs. Willis stoodtrembling with hope, excitement, and the strange dread often rushingin upon the last moment of expectation. She clung to Mary forsupport, and once said--'Oh, Miss Ponsonby, how composed you are!' Mary's feelings were toodeep--too much concentrated for trembling. She calmed and soothedthe wife's sudden fright, lest 'something should have happened toGeorge;' and she even smiled when the children's scream of ecstacyinfected their mother, when the papa and uncle they had been watchingfor with straining eyes proved to be standing on deck close besidethem.Mary cast her eyes round, and saw nothing of her own. She stoodapart, while the Willis family were in all the rapture of themeeting; she saw them moving off, too happy and sufficient forthemselves even to remember her. She had a dull, heavy sensationthat she must bear all, and this was the beginning; and she was aboutto begin her arrangements for her dreary landing, when Mrs. Willis'sbrother, Mr. Ward, turned back. He was a middle-aged merchant, whomher mother had much liked and esteemed, and there was somethingcheering in his frank, hearty greeting, and satisfaction in seeingher. It was more like a welcome, and it brought the Willises back,shocked at having forgotten her in the selfishness of their own joy;but they had made sure that she had been met. Mr. Ward did not thinkthat she was expected by the Valdivia; Mr. Ponsonby had not mentionedit as likely. So they were all seated in the boat, with the blackrowers; and while the Willises fondled their children, and exchangedhome-news, Mr. Ward sat by Mary, and spoke to her kindly, not openlyreferring to the state of her home, but showing a warmth andconsideration which evinced much delicate sympathy.They all drove together in the Willises' carriage up the sloping roadfrom Callao to Lima, and Mary heard astonishment, such as she hadonce felt, breaking out in screams from the children at the sight ofomnibuses filled with gaily-dressed negroes, and brown horsewomen inPanama hats and lace-edged trousers careering down the road. Butthen, her father had come and fetched her from on board, and thatdear mamma was waiting in the carriage! They entered the old walledtown when twilight had already closed in, and Mrs. Willis wasanxious to take her tired little ones home at once. They were setdown at their own door; but Mr. Ward, with protecting anxiouskindness, insisted on seeing Miss Ponsonby safely home before hewould join them. As they drove through the dark streets, Mary hearda little restless movement, betraying some embarrassment; and atlast, with an evident desire of reassuring her, he said, 'SenoraRosita is thought very pleasing and engaging;' and then, as ifwilling to change the subject, he hastily added, 'I suppose you didnot speak the Pizarro?''No.''She has sailed about three weeks. She takes home your cousin, Mr.Dynevor.'Mary cried out with surprise.'I thought him a complete fixture, but he is gone home for a year.It seems his family property was in the market, and he was anxious tosecure it.''How glad his mother will be!' was all Mary could say, as thererushed over her the thought of the wonderful changes this would makein Dynevor Terrace. Her first feeling was that she must tell Louis;her second, that two oceans were between them; and then she thoughtof Aunt Catharine having lived, after all, to see her son.She had forgotten to expect the turn when the carriage wheeled underthe arched entry of her father's house. All was gloom and stillness,except where a little light shone in a sort of porter's lodge uponthe eager negro features of two blacks, with much gesticulation,playing at dice. They came out hastily at the sound of the carriage;and as Mr. Ward handed out Mary, and inquired for Mr. Ponsonby, sherecognised and addressed the white-woolled old Xavier, the mayordomo. Poor old Xavier! Often had she hunted and teased him, andtried to make him understand 'cosas de Inglalerra,' and to make himcease from his beloved dice; but no sooner did he see her face than,with a cry of joy, 'La Senorita Maria! la Seniorita Maria!' down hewent upon his knees, and began kissing the hem of her dress.All the rest of the negro establishment came round, capering andchattering Spanish; and, in the confusion, Mary could not get herquestion heard--Where was her father? and Xavier's vehement threatsand commands to the others to be silent, did not produce a calm. Atlast, bearing a light, there came forward a faded, sallow dame, witha candle in her hand, who might have sat for the picture of the DuenaRodriguez, and at her appearance the negroes subsided. She was anaddition to the establishment since Mary's departure; but in hermight be easily recognised the Tia, the individual who in Limenianhouseholds holds a position between companion and housekeeper. Sheintroduced herself by the lugubrious appellation of Senora Dolores,and, receiving Mary with obsequious courtesy, explained that theSenor and Senora were at a tertulia, or evening party. She lightedMary and Mr. Ward into the quadra; and there Mr. Ward, shaking handswith her as if he would thereby compensate for all that was wantingin her welcome, promised to go and inform her father of her arrival.Mary stood in the large dark room, with the soft matted floor, andthe windows high up near the carved timbered ceiling, the singlelamp, burning in rum, casting a dim gleam over the well-knownfurniture, by which her mother had striven to give an Englishappearance to the room. It was very dreary, and she would have giventhe world to be alone with her throbbing head, her dull heartache,and the weariness of spirits over-long wound up for the meeting; buther own apartment could be no refuge until it had been cleansed andmade ready, and Dolores and Xavier were persecuting her every momentwith their hospitality and their inquiries. Then came a quick, manlytread, and for a moment her heart almost seemed to stand still, inthe belief that it was her father; but it was only Robson, hurryingin to offer his services and apologies. Perhaps he was the very lastperson she could bear to see, feeling, as she did, that if he hadbeen more explicit all the offence would have been spared. He was somuch aware of all family matters, and was accustomed to so muchconfidence from her father, that she could not believe himunconscious; and there was something hateful to her in the plausiblefrankness and deferential familiarity of his manners, as, brushing uphis sandy hair upon his forehead, he poured forth explanations thatMr. Ponsonby would be delighted, but grieved that no one had met her--Valdivia not expected so soon--not anticipated the pleasure--if theyhad imagined that Miss Ponsonby was a passenger--'My father desired that I would come out by her,' said Mary.'Ay, true--so he informed me; but since later intelligence'--and hecast a glance at Mary, to judge how much further to go; but meetingwith nothing but severity, he covered the impertinence by saying, 'Infact, though the Valdivia was mentioned, and Mrs. Willis, Mr.Ponsonby had reason to suppose you would not receive his letters intime to avail yourself of the escort.''I did so, however,' said Mary, coldly.'Most gratifying. Mr. and Mrs. Ponsonby will be highly gratified.In fact, Miss Ponsonby, I must confess that was a most unfortunateblunder of mine last August. I should not have fallen into the errorhad I not been so long absent at Guayaquil that I had had noopportunity of judging of the amiable lady; and I will own to muchnatural surprise and some indignation, before I had had the pleasureof personal acquaintance with the charms and the graces--Hem! Ineffect, it was a step that no one could have recommended; and whenyour noble relative put it to me in so many words whether I wouldcounsel your continuing your journey, I could not take it on me tourge a measure so painful to your feelings, unaware as I was then ofthe amiable qualities of the lady who occupies the situation of thehighly beloved and esteemed--'Mary could not bear to hear her mother's name in his mouth, so shecut him short by saying, 'I suppose you thought you acted for thebest, Mr. Robson; it was very unfortunate, but it cannot be helped.Pray can you tell me where the lad Madison is?' she added, resolvedto show him that she would not discuss these matters with him; 'Ihave a parcel for him.''He is at the San Benito mine, Miss Ponsonby.''How does he go on?''Well--I may say very well, allowing for inexperience. He appears asteady, intelligent lad, and I have no doubt will answer the purposewell.'There was one gratification for Mary, at least, in the pleasure thiswould afford at home; but Robson continued making conversation aboutMr. Dynevor's visit to England, and the quantity of work thistemporary absence entailed on him; and then on the surprise it wouldbe to his patron to find her, and Senora Rosita's interest in her,and the numerous gaieties of the bride, and the admiration sheexcited, and his own desire to be useful. This afforded Mary anopportunity for getting rid of him at last, by sending him to makearrangements for her baggage to be sent from Callao the next morning.Ten minutes more, half spent in conquering her disgust, half in sickanticipation, and other feet were crossing the matted sala, thecurtain over the doorway was drawn aside, and there stood her father,and a lady, all white and diamonds, by his side. He held out hisarms, Mary fell into them, and it was the same kind rough kiss whichhad greeted her six years back. It seemed to be forgiveness,consolation, strength, all at once; and their words mingled--'Papa,you forgive me'--'Mary, my good girl, I did not think they wouldhave let you come back to me. This was but a dreary coming home foryou, my dear.' And then, instantly changing his language to Spanish,he added, appealing to his wife, that had they guessed she was onboard, they would have come to meet her.Rosita replied earnestly to that effect, and warmly embraced Mary,pitying her for such an arrival, and hoping that Dolores had made hercomfortable. The rest of the conversation was carried on in the sametongue. Rosita was much what Mary had expected--of a beautifulfigure, with fine eyes, and splendid raven hair, but without muchfeature or expression. She looked almost like a dream to-night,however, with her snowy robes, and the diamonds sparkling with theirdewdrop flashes in her hair and on her arms, with the fitful lightcaught from the insufficient candles. All she ventured to say had atimid gracefulness and simplicity that were very winning; and herhusband glanced more than once to see if she were not gaining uponhis daughter; and so in truth she was, personally, though it wasexceedingly painful to see her where Mary had been used to see thatdear suffering face; and it was impossible not to feel the contrastwith her father as painfully incongruous. Mr. Ponsonby was a largeman, with the jovial manner of one never accustomed to self-restraint; good birth and breeding making him still a gentleman, inspite of his loud voice and the traces of self-indulgence. He wasruddy and bronzed, and his eyebrows and hair looked as if touched byhoar frost; altogether as dissimilar a partner as could be devisedfor the slender girlish being by his side.After a little Spanish conversation, all kind on his aide, and thusinfinitely relieving Mary, they parted for the night. She laidbefore him the packet of letters, which she had held all this time asthe last link to Louis, and sought his eye as she did so with a lookof appeal; but he carefully averted his glance, and she could readnothing.Weary as she was, Mary heard again and again, through her unglazedwindows, the watchman's musical cry of 'Ave Maria purisima, las--estemblado!' 'Viva Peru y sereno!' and chid herself for foolishanticipations that Louis would hear and admire all the strange soundsof the New World. The kindness of her welcome gave her a littlehope; and she went over and over again her own part of the discussionwhich she expected, almost persuading herself, that Louis's ownconduct and her aunt's testimony must win the day.She need not have spent so many hours in preparation for the morning.She was np early, in hopes of seeing her father before he went to hisoffice, but he was gone for a ride. The English breakfast, which hadbeen established, much to his content, by her own exertions, hadquite vanished, each of the family had a cup of chocolate in private,and there was no meeting till, late in the morning, Rosita saunteredinto her room, embraced her, made inquiries as to her rest, informedher that she was going to the Opera that night, and begged her toaccompany her. To appear in public with Rosita was the tribute forwhich Mary had come out, so she readily agreed; and thereupon theSenora digressed into the subject of dress, and required of Mary adisplay of all her robes, and an account of the newest fashions ofthe English ladies. It was all with such innocent, earnest pleasure,that Mary could not be annoyed, and good-naturedly made all herdisappointing display.The midday meal brought her father--still kind and affectionate, butnever dropping the Spanish, nor manifesting any consciousness of herletters. She had hopes of the period allotted to the siesta, towhich custom, in old days, she had never acceded, but had alwaysspent the interval on any special occupation--above all, to writingfor him; but he went off without any notice of her, and she was in nocondition to dispense with the repose, for her frame was tired out,though her hopes and fears could not even let her dreams rest.Then came a drive with Rosita, resplendent in French millinery, thensupper; then the Opera, to which her father accompanied them, stillwithout a word. Another day was nearly the same, only that this timeshe had to do her best to explain the newest fashions in behalf of adress of Rosita's, then being made, and in the evening to go to aparty at the Consul's, where she met Mr. Ward, and had some talkwhich she might have enjoyed but for her suspense.On the third, Rosita was made happy by unpacking an elegant littleblack papier mache table, a present from Miss Ponsonby. GoodMelicent! were ever two sisters-in-law more unlike? But LordOrmersfield had done Rosita and her husband good service. If AuntMelicent had first learned the real facts, her wrath would have beenextreme--a mere child, a foreigner, a Roman Catholic, a nun! Herhorror would have known no bounds, and she would, perhaps, havebroken with her brother forever. But by making the newly-marriedpair victims of injustice, the Earl had made the reality a relief,and Melicent had written civilly to her brother, and a sisterly sortof stiff letter to the bride--of which the Limenian could notunderstand one word; so that Mary had to render it all into Spanish,even to her good aunt's hopes that Rosita would be kind to her, anduse all her influence in favour of her happiness.Whether Rosita would have comprehended this without Mary's blushesmight be questioned, but she did say, 'Ah! yes! you were to havemarried the Visconde, were you not? El Senor was so angry! Did hisfather forbid when your father refused your portion?''Oh no, he would receive me if I brought nothing.''And you wish to marry?' said Rosita.'If my father would only consent.''But why did you come here then?' said Rosita, opening her largeeyes.'My father commanded me.''England is a long way off,' said Rosita, languidly, 'he could nothave reached you there. You would have been a great lady and noble!How could you come away, if he would still have you?''Because it would have been wrong. We could not have been happy indisobeying my father.''Ah! but you could have done penance. I had many penances to do forquitting my convent; Padre Inigo was very severe, but they are overat last, and I am free for giving alms twice a week, and the Sistershave forgiven me, and send me so many silver flowers and dulces; Iwill show them to you some day. Could you not have done penance?''I am afraid not.''Ah! I forgot you were a heretic, poor thing! How inconvenient! Andso you will not come with me to the bull-fight next Sunday?'Such being Rosita's ideas on the point, Mary gave up much hope in herinfluence, and tried what a good-humoured announcement of her re-establishment of the English breakfast would effect towards bringingher father to a tete-a-tete, but he never came near it. The waitingin silence was miserable enough for herself, but she would havecontinued to bear it except for the injustice to Louis, who must notbe kept in suspense. The departure of the next English mail shouldbe the limit of her endurance, and after a day of watching, shefinally went up to her father when he would have bidden her goodnight, and said, in English, 'Papa, if you please, I must speak toyou.''So you shall, my dear, but we are all tired; we must have ournight's rest.''No, papa, it must be to-night, if you please. It is necessary forme to know before to-morrow how I am to write to Lord Fitzjocelyn.''Pshaw! Mary, I've settled that young fellow!''Papa, I don't think you know--''I've written him a civil answer, if that's what you mean, muchciviller than he or his father deserve,' he said, speaking loud, andtrying to fling away from her, but she stood her ground, and spokecalmly and. steadily, though her heart beat violently.'You do not understand the true state of the case, papa; and withoutdoing so, you cannot write such an answer aa they deserve.''I know this, that old Ormersfield has been the curse of my life!'and out poured one of those torrents of fierce passion which had beenslowly but surely the death of his wife. Mary had never heard one inthe full tide before, but she stood firm; there were none of thetears, auch as, in her mother, had been wont to exasperate himfurther, but with pale cheeks, compressed lips, and hands lockedtogether, her heart was one silent entreaty that it might be forgivenhim above. Thus she stood while the storm of anger raged, and whenat last it had exhausted itself, he said, in a lower voice, 'And soyou are still taken with this fellow's son, this young puppy! Ithought you had more spirit and sense, Mary, or I never would havetrusted you among them.''There are very few people in this world half so good or so right-minded as Fitzjocelyn,' said Mary, earnestly and deliberately. 'Itwas he who bade me come to you, well knowing that we could never behappy without your consent.''Oh! he did so, did he? He is deeper than I thought would not riskyour fortune. Why, Mary, I did not think a girl of your sense couldbe so taken in! It is transparent, I tell you. They get you there,flatter you up with their attentions, but when they find you too wisefor them the first time, off goes this youth to Miss Conway, findsher a bad speculation, no heiress at all, and disposes of her to hiscousin. I wonder if he'll find old Dynevor grateful. Meanwhile theold Lord must needs come out here, finds our gains a better prizethan he expected, trumps up this story at Valparaiso, takes you in,and brings you home to this precious youth. And you, and your aunttoo, are ready to believe it all! I always knew that women werefools whenever a title came in their way, I see it more than evernow, since you and Melicent are both like the rest of 'em.''Papa,' said Mary, again rallying her firmness, 'we have found sadlyhow easy it is to be deceived when one is not on the spot. Will youlisten to me, who saw it all?''No, Mary, I will not hear the nonsense they have put into your head,my poor girl. No! I tell you it is of no use! It is my resolutepurpose that not one farthing of mine shall go to patch up thebroken-down Ormersfield property! The man is my enemy, and has sowndissension in my family from the first moment I connected myself withhim. I'll never see my daughter his son's wife. I wonder he had theimpudence to propose it! I shall think you lost to all feeling foryour father, if you say another word about it.''Very well,' said Mary, with steady submission. 'Then I will onlywrite one more letter to Fitzjocelyn, and tell him that yourobjections are insuperable, and that he must think of it no more.''That's right, Mary! you are a good girl, after all! You'll stand byyour father, in spite of all the House of Peers! I'm glad to see youhold up your head so bravely. So you did fancy being a Viscountess,did you! but it is not a heartbreaking matter either, my girl!'This was too much for Mary, and when her father would have kissedher, she laid her head on his shoulder and wept silently butbitterly.'Ha! what's all this? Why, you don't pretend to care for a youngmercenary scamp like that?''He is the noblest, most generous, most disinterested man I everknew!' said Mary, standing apart, and speaking clearly. 'I give himup because--you command me, father, but I will not hear him spoken ofunjustly.''Ha! ha! so long as you give him up, we won't quarrel. He shall beall that, and more too, if you like; and we'll never fight over thematter again, since I have you safe back, my child.''I do not mean to mention him again,' said Mary; 'I wish to obeyyou.''Then there's an end of the matter. You'll get over it, my girl, andwe'll find some honest man worth two of your niggardly, proud-spirited earls. There, I know you are a reasonable girl that can besilent, and not go on teasing. So, Mary, you may have a cup of teafor me to-morrow in the sala, like old times. Goodnight, my dear.'Waiting upon himself! That was the reward that Mr. Ponsonby held outto his daughter for crushing her first love!But it was a reward. Anything that drew her father nearer to her wasreceived with gratitude by Mary, and the words of kindness in somedegree softened the blow. She had never had much hope, though now shefound it had been more than she had been willing to believe; and evennow she could not absolutely cease to entertain some hopes of theresults of Oliver's return, nor silence one lingering fancy thatLouis might yet wait unbound; although she told herself of hisvacillation between herself and Isabel, of his father's influence,and of the certainty that he would see many more worthy of his lovethan herself. Not any one who could love him so well--oh no! Butwhen Mary found her thoughts taking this turn, she rose up as shelay, clasped her hands together, and repeated half aloud again andagain, 'Be Thou my all!'And by the morning, though Mary's cheek was very white, and her eyessunken for want of sleep, she had a cheerful word for her father, anda smile, the very sight of which would have gone to the heart of anyone of those from whom he had cut her off.Then she wrote her letters. It was not so hard to make this finalseverance as it had been to watch Louis's face, and think of the painshe had to inflict. Many a time had she weighed each phrase she setdown, so that it might offend neither against sincerity norresignation, and yet be soothing and consoling. Some would havethought her letter stiff and laboured, but she had learned to believethat a grave and careful style befitted a serious occasion, and wouldhave thought incoherency childish or affected.She released him entirely from his engagement, entreating him not torebel against the decision, but to join her in thankfulness that noshade need be cast over the remembrance of the happy hours spenttogether; and begging him not to grieve, since she had, after thefirst pain, been able to acquiesce in the belief that the separationmight conduce to his happiness; and she should always regard him asone of those most near and dear to her, and rejoice in whatever wasfor his welfare, glad that his heart was still young enough to formnew ties. 'Forgive me for speaking thus,' she added; 'I know that itmay wound you now, but there may come a time when it may make youfeel more at ease and unfettered; and I could not endure to imaginethat the affection which you brought yourself to lavish on one sounworthy, should stand in the way of your happiness for life.' Shedesired him to make no answer, but to consider this as the finaldissolution: and she concluded by all that she thought would provemost consoling, as to the present state of affairs with her; and witha few affectionate words, to show that he was still a great deal toher, though everything he might not be.This done, Mary faced her life in the New World. She had to form herhabits for herself, for her importance in the house was gone; but shewent to work resolutely, and, lonely as she was, she had far moreresources than if she had never been at Ormersfield. She had manyhours to herself, and she unpacked her books, and set herself coursesof study, to which Louis had opened the door. She unveiled her eyesto natural history, and did not find flower or butterfly unsoothing.She undertook the not very hopeful task of teaching a tiny negro imp,who answered the purpose of a bell, to read and work; and she waspersevering in her efforts to get Xavier and Dolores to make herfather comfortable.Her father was decidedly glad of her company. He liked conversation,and enjoyed the morning meeting, to which Mr. Ward was often awelcome addition, delighting in anything so English, and finding MissPonsonby much improved by her introduction to English society.Sometimes Mary wrote for her father, and now and then was consulted;and she was always grateful for whatever made her feel herself ofuse. She was on kind and friendly terms with Rosita, but they didnot become more intimate than at first. The Senora was swinging in ahammock half-asleep, with a cigarette between her lips, all themorning; and when she emerged from this torpid state, in a splendidtoilette, she had too many more congenial friends often to need herstep-daughter in her visits, her expeditions to lotteries, and hercalls on her old friends the nuns. On a fast-day, or any otheroccasion that kept her at home, she either arranged her jewels,discussed her dresses, or had some lively chatter, which she calledlearning English. She coaxed, fondled, and domineered prettily overMr. Ponsonby; and he looked on amused, gratified her caprices,caressed her, and seemed to regard her as a pretty pet and plaything.CHAPTER VI.THE TWO PENDRAGONS. The red dragon and the white, Hard together gan they smite, With mouth, paw, and tail, Between hem was full hard batail. The History of Merlin.SPRING was on the borders of summer, when one afternoon, as Clara satwriting a note in the drawing-room, she heard a tap at the door ofthe little sitting-room, and springing to open it, she beheld awelcome sight.'Louis! How glad I am! Where do you come from?''Last from the station,' said Louis.'What makes you knock at that door, now the drawing-room is alive?''I could not venture on an unceremonious invasion of Mrs. JamesFrost's territory.''You'll find no distinction of territory here,' laughed Clara. 'Itwas a fiction that we were to live in separate rooms, like naughtychildren. Does not the drawing-room look nice?''As much improved as the inhabitant. Where are the other natives?''Granny and Isabel are walking, and will end by picking up Jem comingout of school. We used to wait for him so often, that at last hesaid we should be laughed at, so there's a law against it which noone dares to transgress but granny.''So I conclude that you are a happy family.''After all, it was worth spending two years at school to enjoyproperly the having it over.''I give Jem credit for having secured a first-rate governess foryou.''That she is! Why, with her I really do like reading and drawing allthe morning! I almost believe that some day I shall wake up and findmyself an accomplished young lady! And, Louis, have you read thelast Western Magazine?''I have read very little for sport lately.''Then I must tell you. Jem was bemoaning himself about havingnothing to give to the new Blind Asylum, and the next evening Isabelbrought out the prettiest little manuscript book, tied with blueribbon, and told him to do as he pleased with it. It was a charmingaccount of her expedition to the Hebrides, written out for hersisters, without a notion of anything further; but Jem sent it tothis Magazine, and it is accepted, and the first part is out. Shewill have quite a sum for it, and all is to go to the Blind Asylum!''Capital!--Let me take it home to night, Clara, and I will stand anexamination on it to-morrow.''We ask her whether she projects a sketch of the Paris Revolution,'said Clara, laughing. 'She has a famous heap of manuscripts in herdesk, and one long story about a Sir Roland, who had his name beforeshe knew Jem, but it is all unfinished, she tore out a great manypages, and has to make a new finish; and I am afraid the poor knightis going to die of a mortal wound at his lady's feet. Isabel likessad things best;--but oh! here they come, and I'm talking dreadfultreason.'Three more joyous-looking people could hardly have been found thanthose who entered the room, welcoming Louis with delight, and askingwhat good wind had brought him.'Partly that Inglewood is crying out for the master's eye,' saidLouis; 'and partly that my father fancied I looked fagged, and kindlylet me run down for a holiday.''I am of his mind,' said Mrs. Frost, tenderly; 'there is an M.P.expression gathering on your brows, Louis.''For you to dispel, Aunt Kitty. I told him you were the bestdissipation, and Virginia was of the same mind. Isabel, she saysDynevor Terrace is the only place she ever wishes to see again.''Do you often see Virginia?' asked Isabel.'Not unless I go early, and beg for her; and then she generally hassome master. That last onset of accomplishments is serious!''Yes,' said Isabel, 'the sense of leisure and tranquillity here ismarvellous!''Not leisure in the sense of idleness,' said James.'No,' said Isabel; 'but formerly idle requirements thronged my time,and for nothing worth doing could I find leisure.''There is nothing more exacting than idle requirements,' said James.'Pray is Clara accepting that invitation? Come to dinner, Louis, andgive us an excuse.''No, he won't,' said Mrs. Frost, 'he will take my side. These youngpeople want to cast off all their neighbours.''Now, granny,' exclaimed James, 'have we not dutifully dined allround? Did not Isabel conduct Clara to that ball? Is it not hard toreproach us with sighing at an evening immolated at the shrine of theRichardsons?''Well, my dears, you must judge.''I am ready to do whatever you think right; I leave you to settleit,' said Isabel, moving out of the room, that Louis might be freefor a more intimate conversation.'Now,' cried James, 'is it in the nature of things that she shouldlive in such society as Mrs. Walby's and Mrs. Richardson's? Peoplewho call her Mrs. James!''Such a queen as she looks among them!' said Clara.'One comfort is, they don't like that,' said James. 'Even Mrs.Calcott is not flattered by her precedence. I hope we shall soon bedropped out of their parties. As long as I do my duty by their sons,what right have they to impose the penance of their society on mywife? All the irksomeness of what she has left, and none of thecompensations!''Blissful solitude' said Louis, 'thereto I leave you.''You are not going yet! You mean to dine here?' was the cry.'My dear friends,' he said, holding up his hands, 'if you only knewhow I long to have no one to speak to!''You crying out for silence!' exclaimed James.'I am panting for what I have not had these five months--space for mythoughts to turn round.''Surely you are at liberty to form your own habits!' said James.'I am told so whenever my father sees me receive a note,' said Louis,wearily; 'but I see that, habituated as he is to living alone, he isnever really at ease unless I am in the way; so I make our hoursagree as far as our respective treadmills permit; and though we donot speak much, I can never think in company.''Don't you have your rides to yourself?''Why, no. My father will never ride enough to do him good, unless hewants to do me good. People are all surprised to see him looking sowell; the country lanes make him quite blooming.''But not you, my poor boy,' said his aunt; 'I am afraid it is a sadstrain.''There now, Aunt Kitty, I am gone. I must have the pleasure oflooking natural sometimes, without causing any vituperation of anyone beyond seas.''You shall look just as you please if you will only stay. We arejust going to dinner.''Thank you, let me come to-morrow. I shall be better company when Ihave had my sulk out.'His aunt followed him to the stairs, and he turned to her, saying,anxiously, 'No letter?' She shook her head. 'It would be barelypossible,' he said, 'but if it would only come while I am at home inpeace!''Ah! this is sadly trying!' said she, parting his hair on his brow ashe stood some steps below her, and winning a sweet smile from him.'All for the best,' he said. 'One thing may mitigate another. Thatpolitical whirlpool might suck me in, if I had any heart or hopes forit. And, on the other hand, it would be very unwholesome to be leftto my own inertness--to be as good for nothing as I feel.''My poor dear boy, you are very good about it. I wish you could havebeen spared.''I did not come to make you sad, Aunt Kitty,' he replied, smiling;'no; I get some energy back when I remember that this may be aprobation. Her mother would not have thought me man enough, and thatis what I have to work for. Whether this end well or not, she is theleading star of my life.' And, with the renewal of spirit with whichhe had spoken, he pressed his aunt's hand, and ran down stairs.When he rode to Northwold, the following afternoon, having spent themorning in walking over his fields, he overtook a most comfortablecouple--James and Isabel, returning from their holiday stroll, andLouis, leaving his horse at the inn, and joining them, began to hearall their school affairs. James had thrown his whole heart into hiswork, had been making various reforms, introducing new studies,making a point of religious instruction, and meditating on a courseof lectures on history, to be given in the evenings, the attendanceto be voluntary, but a prize held out for proficiency. Louis took upthe subject eagerly, and Isabel entered into the discussion with allher soul, and the grammar-school did indeed seem to be in a way tobecome something very superior in tone to anything Northwold hadformerly seen, engrossing as it did all the powers of a man of suchability, in the full vigour of youth.Talking earnestly, the trio had reached the Terrace, and James wasunlatching the iron gate, when he interrupted himself in the midst ofdetailing his views on modern languages to say, 'No, I have nothingfor you.''Sir, I beg your pardon!' was the quick reply from a withered, small,but not ill-dressed old man, 'I only asked--''Let the lady pass,' said James, peremptorily, wishing to save hiswife from annoyance, 'it is of no use, I never look at petitions.''Surely he is not a beggar!' said Isabel, as he drew her on.'You may be easy about him, my dear,' said James. 'He has laid holdof Louis, who would swallow the whole Spanish legion of impostors.He will be after us directly with a piteous story.'Louis was after him, with a face more than half arch fun--'Jem, Jem,it is your uncle!''Nonsense! How can you be so taken in! Don't go and disappointgranny--I'll settle him.''Take care, Jem--it is Oliver, and no mistake! Why, he is as likeyou as Pendragon blood can make him! Go and beg his pardon.'James hastened down stairs, as Louis bounded up--sought Mrs. Frost inthe sitting-rooms, and, without ceremony, rushed up and knocked atthe bed-room door. Jane opened it.'He is come!' cried Louis--'Oliver is come.'Old Jane gave a shriek, and ran back wildly, clapping her hands. Hermistress started forward--'Come!--where?''Here!--in the hall with Jem.'He feared that he had been too precipitate, for she hid her face inher hands; but it was the intensity of thanksgiving; and though herwhole frame was in a tremor, she flew rather than ran forward, nevereven seeing Louis's proffered arm. He had only reached the landing-place, when beneath he heard the greeting--'Mother, I can take youhome--Cheveleigh is yours.' But to her the words were drowned in herown breathless cry--'My boy! my boy!' She saw, knew, heard nothing,save that the son, missed and mourned for thirty-four years, was safewithin her arms, the longing void filled up. She saw not that thestripling had become a worn and elderly man,--she recked not how hecame. He was Oliver, and she had him again! What was the rest toher?Those words? They might be out of taste, but Fitzjocelyn guessedthat to speak them at the first meeting had been the vision ofOliver's life--the object to which he had sacrificed everything.And yet how chill and unheeded they fell!Louis could have stood moralizing, but his heart had begun to throbat the chance that Oliver brought tidings of Mary. He felt himselfan intrusive spectator, and hastened into the drawing-room, whenClara nearly ran against him, but stood still. 'I beg your pardon,but what is Isabel telling me? Is it really?''Really! Kindred blood signally failed to speak.'Clara took a turn up and down the room. 'I say, Louis, ought I to godown?''No; leave him and granny to their happiness,' said Louis; and James,at the same moment running up, threw himself into a chair, with anemphatic 'There!''Dear grandmamma!' said Isabel; 'I hope it is not too much for her.'James made no answer.'Are you disappointed in him, dear James?' she continued.'I could not be disappointed,' he answered, shortly.'Poor man--he has a poor welcome among you,' said Louis.'Welcome is not to be bought,' said James. 'I could not standhearing him reply to poor granny's heartfelt rapture with his richesand his Cheveleigh, as if that were all she could prize.'Steps were mounting the stairs, and the alert, sharp tones of Oliverwere heard--'Married then? Should have waited--done it in style.'James and Isabel glanced at each other in amused indignation; andMrs. Frost entered, tremulous with joy, and her bright hazel eyeslustrous with tears, as she leant on the arm of her recovered son.He was a little, spare, shrivelled man, drolly like his nephew, butwith all the youthfulness dried out of him, the freckles multipliedby scores, and the keen black eyes sunken, sharpened, and surroundedwith innumerable shrewd puckers. The movements were even more brisk,as if time were money; and in speech, the small change of particleswas omitted, and every word seemed bitten off short at the end; thewhole man, in gesture, manner, and voice, an almost grotesquecaricature of all James's peculiarities.'Mrs. Roland Dynevor, I presume? said Oliver, as Isabel came forwardto meet him.'Never so known hitherto,' returned her husband. 'My wife is Mrs.James Frost, if you please.''That is over now,' said Oliver, consequentially; and as his motherpresented to him 'poor Henry's little Clara,' he kissed heraffectionately, saying, 'Well-grown young lady, upon my word! Likeher father--that's right.''Here is almost another grandchild,' said Mrs. Frost--'LouisFitzjocelyn--not much like the Fitzjocelyn you remember, but a newM.P. as he was then.''Humph!' said Oliver, with a dry sound, apparently expressing, 'Sothat is what our Parliament is made of. Father well?' he asked.'Quite well, thank you, sir.'Oliver levelled his keen eyes on him, as though noting downobservations, while he was burning for tidings of Mary, yet held backby reserve and sense of the uncongeniality of the man. His aunt,however, in the midst of her own joy, marked his restless eye, andput the question, whether Mary Ponsonby had arrived?'Ha! you let her go, did you?' said Oliver, turning on Louis. 'Itold her father you'd be no such fool. He was in a proper rage atyour letter, but it would have blown over if you had stuck by her,and he is worth enough to set you all on your legs.'Louis could not bring himself to make any answer, and his motherinterrupted by a question as to Dona Rosita.'Like all the rest. Eyes and feet, that's all. Foolish business!But what possessed Ormersfield to make such a blunder? I never sawPonsonby in such a tantrum, and his are no trifles.''It was all the fault of your clerk, Robson,' said James; 'he wouldnot refute the story.''Sharp fellow, Robson,' chuckled Oliver; 'couldn't refute it. No; ashe told me, he knew the way Ponsonby had gone on ever since his wifewent home, and of late he had sent him to Guayaquil, about theEquatorial Navigation--so he had seen nothing;--and, says he to me,he had no notion of bringing out poor Miss Ponsonby--did not knowwhether her father would thank him; and yet the best of it is, thathe pacifies Ponsonby with talking of difficulty of dealing withpreconceived notions. Knows how to get hold of him. Marriage wouldnever have been if he had been there, but it was the less damage.Mary would have had more reason to have turned about, if she had notfound him married.''But, Oliver,' said his mother, 'I thought this Robson was an honestman, in whom you had entire confidence!''Ha! ha! D'ye think I'd put that in _any_ man? No, no; he knows howfar to go with me. I've plenty of checks on him. Can't get businessdone but by a wide-awake chap like that.''Is Madison under him?' asked Louis, feeling as if he had beenapprenticing the boy to a chief of banditti.'The lad you sent out? Ay. Left him up at the mines. Sharp fellow,but too raw for the office yet.''Too scrupulous!' said James, in an undertone, while his uncle wasexplaining to his mother that he could not have come away withoutleaving Robson to manage his affairs, and Mr. Ponsonby, and tellingexultingly some stories of the favourite clerk's sharp practice.The party went down together in a not very congenial state.Next to Mrs. Frost's unalloyed gladness, the most pleasant spectaclewas old Jane, who volunteered her services in helping to wait, thatshe might have the delight of hovering about Master Oliver, to whomshe attended exclusively, and would not let Charlotte so much asoffer him the potatoes. And Charlotte was in rather an excited stateat the presence of a Peruvian production, and the flutter ofexpecting a letter which would make her repent of the smiles andblushes she had expended over an elaborate Valentine, admired as anoriginal production, and valued the more, alas! because poor Mariannehad received none. Charlotte was just beginning to repent of herungenerous triumph, and agitation made her waiting less deft andpretty than usual; but this mattered the less, since to Oliver anyattendance by women-servants was a shock, as were the small table andplain fare; and he looked round uneasily.'Here is an old friend, Oliver,' said his mother, taking up a curiousold soup-ladle.'I see. It will take some time to get up the stock of plate. Ishall give an order as I pass through London. To be engraved withthe Dynevor crest as before, or would you prefer the lozenge, ma'am?''Oh, my dear, don't talk of it now! I am only sorry this is nothingbut mutton-broth; but that's what comes of sudden arrivals, Oliver.''It shall be remedied at home,' said Oliver, as if he consideredmutton-broth as one degree from famine.'I know you had it for me,' said Louis. 'If Jane excels in one artbefore all others, it is in mutton-broth.'Oliver darted a glance as if he imagined this compliment to be merederision of his mother and Jane.Things went on in this style all the evening. Oliver had two ideas-Cheveleigh, and the Equatorial Steam Navigation Company--and on thesehe rang the changes.There was something striking in his devotion of a lifetime to redeemhis mother's fortunes, but the grandeur was not easily visible in thedetail. He came down on Dynevor Terrace as a consequential, moneyedman, contemptuous of the poverty which he might have alleviated, andobtruding tardy and oppressive patronage. He rubbed against the newgeneration in too many places for charity or gratitude to be easy.He was utterly at variance with taste, and openly broached unworthysentiments and opinions, and his kindness and his displeasure wereequally irksome. If such repugnance to him were felt even by Louis,the least personally affected, and the best able to sympathize withhis aunt; it was far stronger in James, abhorring patronage, sensiblethat, happen what might, his present perfect felicity must bedisturbed, and devoid of any sentiment for Cheveleigh that could makethe restoration compensate for the obligation so unpleasantlyenforced; and Isabel's fastidious taste made her willing to holdaloof as far as might be without vexing the old lady.There was no amalgamation. Fitzjocelyn and Isabel were near thewindow, talking over her former home and her sisters, and all theparticulars of the society which she had left, and he had entered;highly interesting to themselves and to the listening Clara, but tothe uninitiated sounding rather like 'taste, Shakspeare, and themusical glasses.'Oliver and his mother, sitting close together, were living in an oldworld; asking and answering many a melancholy question on friends,dead or lost sight of, and yet these last they always made sure thatthey should find when they went home to Cheveleigh--that home towhich the son reverted with unbroken allegiance; while the whole wasinterspersed with accounts of his plans, and explanations of his vastdesigns for the renovation of the old place.James hovered on the outskirts of both parties, too little at ease toattach himself to either; fretted by his wife's interest in a worldto which he was a stranger, impatient of his uncle's plans, andtrebly angered by observing the shrewd curious glances which the oldman cast from time to time towards the pair by the window.Fortunately, Mrs. Frost was still too absolutely wrapt in maternaltransport to mark the clouds that were gathering over her peace. Tolook at her son, wait on him, and hear his voice, so fully satisfiedher, that as yet it made little difference what that voice said, andit never entered her mind to suppose that all her dear ones were notsharing her bliss.'You were the first to tell me,' she said, as she bade Louis goodnight with fondness additional to her messenger of good news; but, ashe pressed her dear old trembling hand, his heart misgave him whetherher joy might not be turned to pain; and when he congratulated Jane,and heard her call it a blessed day, he longed to be certain that itwould prove so.And, before he could sleep that night, he wrote a letter to TomMadison, warning him to let no temptation nor bad example lead himaside from strict justice and fair dealing; and advising him ratherto come home, and give up all prospects of rising, than not preservehis integrity.James and Isabel were not merciful to their uncle when they couldspeak of him without restraint; and began to conjecture hisintentions with regard to them.'You don't wish to become an appendage to Cheveleigh?' said James,fondly.'I! who never knew happiness till I came here!''I do not know what my uncle may propose,' said James, 'but I knowyou coincide in my determination that he shall never interfere withthe duties of my office.''You do not imagine that he wishes it?''I know he wishes I were not in Holy Orders. I knew he disliked itat the time of my ordination; but if he wished me to act according tohis views, he should have given himself the right to dictate.''By not neglecting you all your youth.''Not that I regret or resent what concerns myself; but it was hisleaving me a burden on my grandmother that drove me to become aclergyman, and a consistent one I will be, not an idle heir-apparentto this estate, receiving it as his gift, not my own birthright.''An idle clergyman! Never! never!' cried Isabel. 'I should notbelieve it was you! And the school--you could not leave it just asyour plans are working, and the boys improving?''Certainly not; it would be fatal to abandon it to that stick,Powell. Ah! Isabel,' as he looked at her beautiful countenance, 'howI pity the man who has not a high-minded wife! Suppose you camebegging and imploring me not to give any umbrage to the man, becauseyou so doted upon diamonds.''The less merit when one has learnt that they are very cold hardstones,' said Isabel, smiling.Isabel was a high-minded wife, but she would have been a still betterone if her loving admiration had allowed her to soften James, or toquestion whether pride and rancour did not lurk unperceived in themidst of the really high and sound motives that prompted him.While their grandmother could only see Oliver on the best side, Jamesand Isabel could only see him on the worst, and lost the greatness ofthe design in the mercenary habits that exclusive perseverance in ithad produced. It had been a false greatness, but they could notgrant the elevation of mind that had originally conceived it.The following day was Sunday, and nothing worse took place thanlittle skirmishes, in which the uncle and nephew's retort andrejoinder were so drolly similar, that Clara found herself thinkingof Miss Faithfull's two sandy cats over a mouse; but she kept hersimile to herself, finding that Isabel regarded the faintest,gentlest comparison of the two gentlemen almost as an affront. Allactual debate was staved off by Mrs. Frost's entreaty that businessdiscussion should be deferred. 'Humph!' said Oliver, 'you reignhere, ma'am, but that's not the way we get on at Lima.''I dare say,' said James.Mrs. Frost's joy was still undimmed. It was almost a trance ofgladness, trembling in her smile, and overflowing in her eye, atevery congratulation and squeeze of the hand from her friends.'Dear Jemmy,' said she, taking his arm as they went home in theevening, 'did not that psalm seem meant for us?--'If riches increase,set not your heart upon them.''James had been thinking it meant for some one; but, as he said,'certainly not for you, dear granny.''Ah! snares of wealth were set far enough from me for a time! Inever felt so covetous as when there was a report that there was tobe an opposition school. But now your dear uncle is bringingprosperity back, I must take care not to set my heart even on what hehas gained for me.''I defy riches to hurt you,' said James, smiling.'Ah! Jemmy, you didn't know me as a county grandee,' she said, witha bright sad look, 'when your poor grandpapa used to dress me up.I'm an old woman now, past vanities, but I never could sit as looseto them as your own dear wife does. I never tried. Well, it will bechanged enough; but I shall be glad to see poor old Cheveleigh. Itdoes me good to hear poor Oliver call it home. If only we had yourdear father!''To me Dynevor Terrace is home,' said James.'A happy home it has been,' said the old lady.''Goodness and mercy have followed me all the days of my life!' Andnow, Oliver, whom I never thought to see again--oh! what can I do tobe thankful enough! I knew what he was doing! I knew he was notwhat you all thought him! And roughing it has been no harm to you orClara, and it is all over now! And the dear old place comes back tothe old name. Oh, James, I can sometimes hardly contain myself--thatmy poor boy has done it, and all for me, and his brother's children!'James could scarcely find it in his heart to say a single word todamp her joy, and all his resolution enabled him to do was to saygently, 'You know, dear granny, we must not forget that I am aclergyman.''I know. I have been telling your uncle so; but we can do something.You might take the curacy, and do a great deal of good. There usedto be wild places sadly neglected in my time. I hope that, since ithas been given back to us, we may feel it more as a stewardship thanI did when it was mine.'James sighed, and looked softened and thoughtful.'Your uncle means to purchase an annuity for Jane,' she added; 'andif we could only think what to do for the Faithfulls! I wonderwhether they would come and stay with us. At least they can nevervex themselves again at not paying rent!'After a pause--'Jem, my dear, could you manage to give your uncle thetrue account of your marriage? He admires Isabel very much, I cantell you, and is pleased at the connexion. But I fancy, though hewill not say so, that Mr. Ponsonby has desired him to find out all hecan about Louis; and unluckily they have persuaded themselves thatpoor Louis courted Isabel, supposing that she was to haveBeauchastel, and, finding his error, betook himself to Mary.''Turning Isabel over to me! Extremely flattering.''Now, Jem, don't be angry. It is only foolish talk! But unluckilyI can't persuade your uncle not to think the real story all mypartiality; and you might do much more, if it be not too unpleasantto you.''Thank you, granny, it is out of the question. If it were as he doesus the honour to imagine, I should be the last person to confess it.My evidence could be of no service to Fitzjocelyn, when my uncle'smaxim is to place confidence in no one. The sole refutation in mypower is the terms on which we meet.''Now, I have vexed you. I wish I had said nothing about it; but whendear Louis's happiness may depend on his report--''If I were base enough to have acted as he supposes, I should be baseenough to deny it. There is not enough to be hoped to make me speakwith unreserve on such a subject.'He saved himself from saying--to such a man; but the shrewd,suspicious old bachelor was not an inviting confidant for thevicissitudes of delicate and tender feelings of such recent date, andMrs. Frost reproached herself with asking too much of her proud,sensitive grandson.The black gown and trencher cap by no means gratified Oliver, whenJames set off to school on Monday morning; but he consoled himselfwith observing, 'We shall soon put an end to that.''James is quite devoted to the school,' said Isabel, and she wasanswered by the dry growl.'It will be a hard thing to transplant our young people,' said Mrs.Frost, 'they have managed to be very happy here.''So hard of transplantation that I doubt the possibility,' saidIsabel. 'You have made us take very deep root here.''Have you ever seen Cheveleigh, Mrs. Dynevor?''Never.''Poor Oliver! you and I think no place equal to our birthplace,' saidMrs. Frost.'I should think Mrs. Roland Dynevor would find it compensation. Howmany beds did we make up, mother, the year my father was sheriff?''You must go to Jane for that,' said his mother, laughing. 'I'm sureI never knew.''I believe it was twenty-seven,' said Oliver, gravely. 'I know therewere one hundred and eighty-five persons at the ball, and that theroom was hung with blue brocade, mother; and you opened the ball withLord Francis. I remember you had violet satin and white blonde.''My dear, how can you remember such things! You were a little bit ofa schoolboy!''I was sixteen' said Oliver. 'It was the year '13. I will have thedrawing-room hung with blue brocade, and I think Mrs. Roland Dynevorwill own that nothing can exceed it.''Very likely,' said Isabel, indifferently; and she escaped, beckoningwith her Clara, who was rather entertained with the reminiscencesover which granny and Uncle Oliver seemed ready to linger for ever;and yet she was rather ashamed of her own amusement and interest,when she heard her sister-in-law say, 'If he did but know how weary Iam of that hateful thing, a great house!''I hope Cheveleigh is not grander than Ormersfield,' said Clara, inan odd sort of voice.The ladies, for the first time, did not sit together this morning.Clara practised, and Isabel took the Chapel in the Valley out of herdesk, and began a process of turning the Sir Roland into Sir Hubert.Oliver and his mother were in the sitting-room, and, on James'sreturn from school in the middle of the day, he was summoned thither.Mrs. Frost was sitting by the fire, rather tearful and nervous, andher son stood full in the front, as dignified and magnanimous as sizeand features would permit, and the same demeanour was instantly andunconsciously assumed by his nephew, who was beyond measure chafed bythe attempt at a grand coup,'I have requested your presence,' began Oliver, 'as the eldest son ofmy elder brother, and thus, after my mother, the head of our family.You are aware that when unfortunate circumstances involved mymother's property, it was my determination to restore the inheritanceto her, and to my dear brother Henry. For this object, I have workedfor the last thirty-four years, and a fortunate accident havingbrought our family estate into the market, I have been enabled tosecure it. I am now ready to make it over to my mother, with entailto yourself and your heirs, as representatives of my brother Henry,and settling five thousand pounds on your sister, as the portion towhich the younger children of our family have always been entitled.If you are willing to reside at our family seat with my mother, Iwill assure you of a suitable allowance during her lifetime, and--'Nothing was more intolerable to a man like James than a shower ofobligations; and his spirit, angered at the very length of theaddress, caught at the first opening for avoiding gratitude, andbeheld in the last proposal an absolute bribe to make him sacrificehis sacred ministry, and he burst forth, 'Sir, I am much obliged toyou, but no offers shall induce me to forsake the duties of mycalling.''You mistake, if you think I want anything unclerical. No occasionto hunt--Mr. Tresham used in my day--no one thought the worse of him-unlucky your taking Orders.''There is no use in entering on that point,' said James. 'No othercourse was left open to me, and my profession cannot be taken up norlaid down as a matter of convenience.''Young men are taught to think more seriously than they were in ourday,' said Mrs. Frost. 'I told you that you must not try to make himturn squire.''Well! well! good living may be had perhaps. Move to Cheveleigh, andlook out for it at leisure, if nothing else will content him. Butwe'll have this drudgery given up. I'll not go home and show mynephew, heir of the Dynevors, keeping a third-rate grammar-school,'said Oliver, with his one remaining Eton quality of contempt forprovincial schools.The Northwold scholar and master were both roused to arms in James.'Sir,' he said, 'you should have thought of that when you left thisheir of the Dynevors to be educated by the charity of this third-rategrammar-school.''Is this your gratitude, sir!' passionately exclaimed Oliver; 'I, whohave toiled my whole life for your benefit, might look for anotherreturn.''It was not for me,' said James. 'It was for family pride. Had itbeen from the affection that claims gratitude, you would not haveleft your mother in her old age, to labour unaided for the support ofyour brother's orphans. For ourselves, I thank you; the habitsnurtured by poverty are the best education; but I cannot let yousuppose that a grand theatrical restoration can atone to me forthirty years' neglect of my grandmother, or that my gratitude can beextorted by benefactions at the expense of her past suffering.''Jem! dear Jem! what are you saying!' cried Mrs. Frost. 'Don't youknow how kindly your uncle meant? Don't you know how happy we havebeen?''You may forgive. You are his mother, and you were injured, but Ican never forget what I have seen you undergo.''You foolish boy, to forget all our happiness--''Nor,' proceeded James, 'can I consent to forego the career ofusefulness that has been opened to me.''But, Jem, you could be so useful in the parish! and your uncle couldnot wish you to do anything unhandsome by the trustees--''I wish him to do nothing, ma'am,' said Oliver. 'If he is too highand mighty to accept a favour, it is his own loss. We can do withouthim, if he prefers the Fitzjocelyn patronage. Much good may it dohim!'James deigned no answer, looked at his watch, and found it time toreturn to the school.Oliver broke out into angry exclamations, and his mother did herutmost to soothe him. He had no turn for being a country-gentleman,he was fit for nothing but his counting-house, and he intended toreturn thither as soon as he had installed his mother at Cheveleigh;and so entirely did all his plans hinge upon his nephew, that evennow he was persuaded to hold out his forgiveness, on condition thatJames would apologize, resign the school, and call himself Dynevor.Mrs. Frost hoped that Isabel would prevail on her husband to listenfavourably; but Isabel gloried in his impracticability, and wouldhave regarded any attempt at mediation as an unworthy effort to turnhim aside from the path of duty. She replied, that she would neversay a word to change his notions of right, and she treated poorOliver with all the lofty reserve that she had formerly practisedupon possible suitors.When Fitzjocelyn came in the afternoon to take leave, before hisreturn to London, Mrs. Frost begged him to use his influence withJames. 'Who would have thought it would have so turned out?' shesaid. 'My poor Oliver! to be so met after all his generous plans!and yet Jem does want to do right!'Unfortunately, Louis felt that, to own Oliver's generosity, it wasnecessary to be out of sight of him; and finding that there wassilence and constraint in the drawing-room, he asked Isabel to walkwith him to meet James.'One breathes freely!' said she, as they left the house. 'Was thereever a more intolerable man?''Never was a man who made a more unlucky error in judgment.''And that is all you call it?''The spurious object warped the mind aside,' said Louis. 'The grandidea was too exclusive, and now he suffers for the exclusiveness. Itis melancholy to see the cinder of a burnt-offering to Mammon,especially when the offering was meant for better things.'In this strain he chose to talk, without coming to particulars, till,near the corner of the old square, they met the shouting throng ofboys, and presently James himself, descending the steps of the grimold grey building.'I thought you would forgive me for coming to meet you under such anescort,' said Isabel, 'especially as it was to escape from ourPeruvian relative.''Poor man! it was a great pity he did not come last year!' saidLouis.'I am glad I have no temptation to bend to his will,' returned James.'Ha! I like the true core of the quarrel to display itself.''Fitzjocelyn, you do not mean that you do not fully approve of thecourse I have taken!''Extremely magnanimous, but not quite unprecedented. Witness St.Ronan's Well, where the younger Scrogie abjures the name of Mowbray.''Pshaw! Louis, can't you understand? Frost is a glorious name tome, recording my grandmother's noble exertions on our behalf, but Ican imagine it to be hateful to him, recalling the neglect that madeher slaving necessary.''For which amiable reason you insist on obtruding it. Pray, are thehouses henceforth to be Frost Terrace or Arctic Row?''Are you come to laugh or to remonstrate?' exclaimed James, stopping.'Oh! you want to put on your armour! Certainly, I should never tellif I were come to remonstrate, nor should I venture in such a case--''Then you are come to approve,' said Isabel. I knew it!''Little you two care--each of you sure of an admiring double.''I care for your opinion as much as ever I did,' said James.'Exactly so,' said Louis, laughing.'I desire to have your judgment in this matter.''If I could judge, I would,' said Louis. 'I see you right inprinciple, but are you right in spirit? I own my heart bleeds forAunt Kitty, regaining her son to battle with her grandson.''I am very sorry for her,' said James; 'but it can't be helped. Icannot resign my duties here for the sake of living dependent on asuitable allowance.''Ah! Jem! Jem! Oliver little knew the damage his neglect did you.''What damage?''The fostering an ugly little imp of independence.''Aye! you grandees have naturally a distaste for independence, andmake common cause against it.''Especially when in a rabid state. Take care, Jem. Independencenever was a Christian duty yet--''Then, you want me to go and live on the hoards for the sake of whichmy grandmother was left to toil. You would like to see me loiteringabout, pensioned to swell the vanity of Cheveleigh, neglecting myvows, forsaking my duties--''You unreasonable man! Is there no way in this whole world for youto do your duty as a clergyman, but hearing Northwold boys the Latingrammar?''Then, what do you want me to do?''I don't want you to do anything. You are the man to know what isright; only, Isabel, don't help him to hate people more than canpossibly be avoided; and don't break dear Aunt Kitty's heart amongstyou. That's what I care most about!'When Louis bade his aunt farewell, he threw his arm round her neck,looked fondly at her, and said, 'Dear aunt, you won't let them teaseyou?''No, my dear, I am getting past being teased,' she said. 'Vexationsdon't hurt me as much as love does me good, and they'll not forgettheir affection. It is all goodness in Jem, and poor Oliver willunderstand it when I have got him into our home ways again; but hehas been so long away from home, poor fellow!''That's right. I won't be uneasy for you. Squabble as they will,they won't hurt you. But, oh! Dynevor Terrace without you!''Ah! you must come to me at _home_!''Home! I'm like Jem, jealous for this old house.''It is odd how little I feel these things,' said his aunt. 'If anyone had told me, when I tore myself away from Cheveleigh, that Ishould have it back, how little I should have thought that I couldtake it so easily! I wonder at myself when I wake in the morningthat I am not more moved by it, nor by leaving this dear old place.I suppose it is because I have not long to stay anywhere. I can keepnothing in my head, but that I have got my Oliver!''I believe it is the peace that is not of this world!' said Louis.CHAPTER VII.ROLAND AND OLIVER 'Twas old ancestral pride, 'Twas hope to raise a fallen house From penury's disgrace, To purchase back from usurers The birthright of his race. The Lump of Gold--C. MACKAY.Mary's letter arrived not long after Louis's return to London; andher calm, serious, beautifully-expressed farewell came upon him atlast like a blow which had been long impending, but of whichpreparation had failed to lessen the weight.'Ah!' said the Earl, when the chief part had been read to him, 'sheis admirable and excellent as ever. It is a great disappointmentthat she is unattainable, but I am glad she writes so sensibly, andsees that it is right you should think no more about her. After all,the connexion with that fellow Ponsonby might have been verytroublesome, and it is well, as she says, that it was all over whileyou are so young.''Young or old, there is no other Mary in the world,' said Louis,sadly.'We will say no more about it now. I understand you, but you willthink differently by-and-by.'Louis did not answer. He knew that others might have been deceivedby the tardiness and uncertainty of his attachment, but that it hadtaken such deep root, that he believed he could no more detachhimself from Mary than if she were his wife. His heart fainted as hethought of years without the strength and soothing which her veryletter breathed forth; as he pictured to himself alternations betweenhis chill and stately home and the weary maze of London, foresawpersuasions from his father to induce him to form some newattachment, and dreaded to think of the facility with which, perhaps,he might still be led out of his own convictions. Yet he stillbelieved that patience and perseverance would win the day, and triedto derive encouragement and energy from the thought that this mightbe a trial sent for the very purpose of training him insteadfastness.A strong impulse drew him to Bryanston Square, where Miss Ponsonbywas very kind and warm, the more so because she had discovered howmuch easier it had been to say than to unsay, and strongly regrettedthe injustice she had done him. He had the satisfaction of talkingfor a good hour about Mary, and of sending a message, that he did notwrite because he wished to be guided by her in everything, and thathe was striving to work so as to please her. The conversation endedwith some good auguries as to the effect of Oliver's return to Peru;and Louis went away cheered, bearing the final dismissal better thanhis father had expected. Lord Ormersfield attributed histranquillity to having his mind settled; and so it was, though notquite as his lordship imagined.Meantime, there was a lull at Dynevor Terrace. Oliver was gone totake possession and furnish the mansion, and Mrs. Frost's greatobject was to keep the subject from irritating her grandson, so as tosave him from binding himself by any rash vows. Cheveleigh wastreated in the domestic circle with judicious silence, Oliver'sletters were read by his mother in private, and their contentscommunicated to Jane alone, whose happiness was surpassing, and hercontempt for Dynevor Terrace quite provoking to poor Mrs. Martha.'Really,' said Charlotte one day, 'I don't think a catastrophe ishalf so pretty as it ought to be. Mr. Oliver is but a poor littlepuny man, and I never knew Mr. James so hard to please.'Charlotte and Marianne had begun to merge their rivalry in honestfriendship, cemented by Marianne's increasing weakness, anddifficulty in getting through even the light work her mistressrequired. Jane petted her now still more than Charlotte, and wasalways promising her the delightful air and the luxuries ofCheveleigh.'See here, Charlotte,' said Marianne, one afternoon when they satdown together to their sewing; Marianne's eyes were brighter, and hercheeks pinker, than for many days--'See here; it is for your good Ishow it you, that you mayn't build on no false expectations. It wasmarked private; but I think it but fair you should see.''Mine was marked private too,' said Charlotte, slowly, as she fixedher eyes on the envelope Marianne held out to her, and putting herhand into her pocket, pulled out a similar one, directed to MissArnold.Marianne scarcely suppressed a shriek, gasped, and turned pale. Eachlady then proceeded to unfold a pink sheet of note-paper, containingan original copy of verses, each labelled, 'On a hair of --.' Thencame a scented shining note, requesting to be informed whether theright construction had been put on some words that had dropped fromthe Miss Conways, and if it were true that the reverend and respectedMr. F. Dynevor had come into a large fortune. In that case, Mr.Delaford, mercenary considerations apart, would take the earliestopportunity of resigning his present position, and entering thefamily which contained his charmer.The Merry Wives were parodied by the hysterical maids. Charlottemight afford to laugh, but Marianne's heart was more in the matter,and they struck up such a chorus that Jane broke upon them, declaringthat they would frighten Mrs. James Frost out of her senses. WhenCharlotte told her what was the matter, her comment was, 'And a verygood thing, too, that you should find him out in time! A pair ofsilly girls you! I always was thankful I never could write, to bedeluded with nonsense by the post; and I am more so than ever now!Come, leave off crying, Marianne; he ain't worth it.''But how shall we answer him, Mrs. Beckett?' said Charlotte.'Never demean yourself to answer him,' said Jane; 'let him never hearnought about you--that's the best for the like of him. I can tellhim he need not be in no hurry about giving warning to Lady Conway.At Cheveleigh we'll have a solemn, steady butler, with no nonsense,nor verses, nor guitars--forty years old--and a married man.'Charlotte took the advice, and acted with dignified contempt andsilence, relieved to imagine that Tom had never been in danger fromsuch a rival. Marianne did not divulge the tender and melancholyletter of reproach that she posted privately; but she grew paler, andcoughed more, all that bright summer.Mrs. Frost had refused to let any cause remove her from Northwold,until after an event which it was hoped would render James lessdisdainful of his inheritance. But--'Was there ever anything more_contrary_?' exclaimed Jane, as she prepared to set out the table fora grand tea. 'There's Master James as pleased and proud of thatthere little brown girl, as if she was as fine a boy as Master Henryhimself. I do believe, upon my word, it is all to spite poor dearMaster Oliver.'Poor Jane, she was almost growing tart in her partizanship of Oliver.The little brown girl was no dove of peace. Her father decidedlytriumphed in the mortification that her sex was to others of thefamily; and though he averred that the birth of a son would not havemade him change his mind, he was well satisfied to be spared theattack which would have ensued. Oliver, like Jane, appeared toregard the poor child as a wilful offence, and revenged himself by aletter announcing that Clara would be his heiress, information whichMrs. Frost kindly withheld from her granddaughter, in the hope of areconciliation.Lord Ormersfield took James in hand, undertaking to make him hearcommon sense; but the sense was unfortunately too common, and theauthoritative manner was irritating, above all when a stately warningwas given that no Church-preferment was to be expected from hisinfluence; whereupon James considered himself insulted, and theyparted very stiff and grand, the Earl afterwards pronouncing thatnothing was so wrongheaded as a conscientious man. But they were toomuch accustomed to be on respectfully quarrelsome terms to altertheir regard for one retort more or less; and after all, there werevery few men whom Lord Ormersfield liked or esteemed half so much asthe fearless and uncompromising James Frost--James Frost--as hecurtly signed himself, in spite of all Louis's wit on Rolands andOlivers--and yet those soft satirical speeches did more than alldirect attacks to shake his confidence in his own magnanimity; moreespecially because Fitzjocelyn always declared himself incompetent tojudge, and never failed to uphold that he was so far right, that hisministry must stand above all worldly considerations.The breach had become so wide, that Oliver would not have acceptedthe terms he had formerly offered. His object seemed to be to piquehis nephew and niece, by showing them what they had lost. He wrotethe most magnificent descriptions of Cheveleigh, and insisted thathis mother and Clara should come and take possession on the eightiethbirthday of the former, the 14th of September; and Isabel wasrecovering so rapidly, that there was nothing to oppose to hisproject, although the new Catharine would be scarcely three weeks oldby that time.Thereupon came down, addressed to Clara, a case of Peruvian jewels,newly set in London--intended doubtless to excite great jealousy inher sister-in-law. Poor Oliver! could he but have known that Isabelonly glanced at them to tell Clara the names of the ornaments, and torelieve her mind by assurances that the whole of a set need not beworn at once! Next arrived an exceedingly smart French milliner,who, by the help of Jane and Marianne, got Clara into her toils, andpinned and measured her for a whole mortal morning; and evengrandmamma ordered a black velvet gown and accompaniments.Lastly, there descended on Clara's devoted head a cheque for a sumwhich terrified her imagination, and orders to equip herself suitablyas Miss Dynevor of Cheveleigh, who was to enjoy the same allowancehalf-yearly. Her first idea was what delightful presents could bemade to every one; but as she was devising showers of gifts for herniece, James cut her short,--'I am sorry to give you pain, Clara, butit must be understood that neither directly nor indirectly can I normine receive anything bought with my uncle's money.''That was the only thing to make me not hate it.''It is best you should hate it.''I do! Why did he come home to bother us? Oh, Jem, can't I stilllive here, and only visit there?''No, Clara. The care of granny is your first duty; and during herlife, so long as you are single, her home must be yours.'The edict was given in stern self-abnegation; but James was very kindto her, treating her as a victim, and spending his leisure in walkingabout with her, that she might take leave of every favourite haunt.He was indulgent enough even to make no objection to going with herto Ormersfield, where she wandered about the park, visited old sceneswith Louis, and went over all his improvements. His cottages had asyet the sole fault of looking too new, and one of his tenants wouldnot shut up his pigs; but otherwise all was going on well, andInglewood was in the excitement of Louis's first harvest. He walkedabout with ears of wheat in his hand, talked knowingly of loads andacres, and had almost taught his father to watch the barometer. Itadded to Clara's regrets that she should miss the harvest-supper, forwhich he and Mr. Holdsworth had wonderful designs; but it was not totake place until Fitzjocelyn's return from Cheveleigh. Oliver hadinvited him and his father to conduct Mrs. Frost thither, and addeclat to her reception; and this, as Clara said, 'was the onlycomfort in the business.'James had effectually destroyed all pleasure on her part, and hadmade the change appear an unmitigated misfortune, even though she didnot know what she would have thought the worst. Congratulations weredreadful to her, and it was all that Isabel could do to persuade herto repress her dislike so as not to distress her grandmother.To Mrs. Frost it was pain to leave what she owned, with thankfultears, to have been a happy, peaceful refuge for her widowhood andpoverty; she grieved over each parting, clung to the Faithfulls,reiterated fond counsels to Isabel, and could hardly bear to detachherself from the great-grandchild. But still it was her own son, andher own home, and Oliver and Cheveleigh were more to her than evenJames and Dynevor Terrace; so that, though she was sorry, it was notwith a melancholy sorrow, and she could still hope against hope, thatuncle and nephew might be brought together at last, and that a son ofJames would yet reign in the dear old place.Besides, she had not time to be unhappy. She was fully employednursing Isabel, doing honour to the little one, answering Oliver'sletters, superintending Clara's wardrobe; choosing parting gifts forinnumerable friends, high and low; and making arrangements for theinexperienced household.Jane's place was to be--not exactly supplied, but occupied by a cook.Miss Dynevor was to have 'a personal attendant;' and Mrs. Beckettbegged that Marianne might be chosen, since she could not bear to seethe poor thing sent away, when in so much need of care. Thediamonds, the French millinery, and Jane's motherly care, came instrong contrast to the miserable lodging, or the consumptivehospital, which poor Marianne had begun to anticipate; and weepingwith gratitude, she declared that she had never seen nor thought ofsuch kindness since her mother died.Isabel seldom roused herself to understand anything about herservants; but she liked Marianne, and was glad Clara should have her,since she was not strong enough to undertake nursery cares. Shebelieved it had not agreed with her to sit up late. Compunction forhaving been the cause had never dawned on Isabel's mind.Charlotte was to remain at Dynevor Terrace; James and Isabel wishedto keep her, and Mrs. Beckett thought her sufficiently indoctrinatedwith her ways to have some chance of going on well. 'Besides,' asJane said, 'I can't be accountable for taking her into that largefamily, until I see what company there may be. She's a well-behavedgirl enough, but she's too pretty and too simple-like for me to haveher among the common run of servants. I'll see what I can do forher, when I see what sort of a housekeeper it is.'And Jane gave Charlotte infinite injunctions, varying from due careof the 'chaney images' to reserve with mankind. 'Because you see,Charlotte' she said, 'you'll be terribly forsaken. Mrs. James, poordear!--she would not know if the furniture weren't rubbed once in tenyears; but you must make it a pride to yourself to be faithful.''I am faithful!' cried Charlotte. 'I never cared for that traitor,Delaford, and his guitar; but I could not get rid of him. And I'lltell you what--I'll seal up his fine red book, and all his verses;and you shall leave them in London as you go through, with mycompliments. I think that will be proper and scornful.''Hoity-toity! That's what she's at! The best thing you can do too,Charlotte; and I'm glad that you've too much spirit to pine like poorMarianne. I'd take my affidavit that if the crowner could sit uponher when she dies--and die she will--that there fine gentleman andhis guitar will be found at the bottom of her chest. But don't gooff about that now--though 'tis the reason I won't part from the poorthing till I can help--the better luck for you that you'd got more inyour head than vanities and furbelows. What I meant was not beingfaithful to him out in Peru--that's your own affair, but the beingfaithful to your duty to your mistress, whether she's after you ornot. You know what a good servant is, and you've got to show itain't all eye-service.'Charlotte cried heartily. No one else was allowed that privilegewhen the 13th came, excepting Mrs. Frost herself. James, afraid thata scene would hurt his wife, severely forbade Clara to give way; andthe poor girl, mute and white, did as she was told, and ventured nota word of farewell, though her embraces were convulsive, and when shewent down stairs she could not help kissing Charlotte.James handed his grandmother to her seat in the carriage which was totake her to the station.'Good-bye, my dear,' she said; 'I know the day will come when allthis will be made up. You know how I have loved you both.''I wish my uncle all good.''I see it now,' she said, holding his hand between both of hers. 'Itis my fault. I fostered our family pride. May God take away the sinfrom us both!'The words were hardly articulate through tears, and perhaps James didnot hear. He hurried Clara down the garden and into the carriage,and she had her last nod from Miss Faithfull at the open window.Miss Mercy was at the station, whither school-hours had hinderedJames from accompanying them, but where they found Lord Ormersfieldand Louis.The warm-hearted little woman was all tears and smiles. 'Oh! dearMrs. Frost, I am so sorry, and yet it is selfish. I am so happy! butwhere shall we find such another neighbour?''Come and see us. You know you are to persuade your sister.''Ah!' She shook her head. 'Salome is hard to move. But you--youare such a traveller--you will come to see Mr. James?''I'm eighty to-morrow: I little expect to make any more journeysexcept one, Mercy. I never look to see poor Northwold more; but ithas been a place of blessings to me, and you have been one of them.Don't think I'm too glad to go away, but I cannot but be thankfulthat my dear boy is bringing me home to lay me down where my fatherand his father lie.'It was said with that peculiar cheerfulness with which happy old agecan contemplate the end of the pilgrimage, and she looked at Louiswith a sunny smile.CHAPTER VIII.THE RESTORATION. When silent time, wi' lightly foot, Had trod on thirty years, I sought again my native land Wi' mony hopes and fears. As I drew near my ancient pile, My heart beat a' the way; The place I passed seemed yet to speak Of some dear former day. Some pensy chiels, a new-sprung race, Wad next their welcome pay; * * * * * * * * But sair on ilka well-kenned face I missed the youthful bloom. Miss BlamireOliver had sent orders to his mother to sleep in London, and proceedthe next morning by a train which would arrive at about two o'clock.On that eventful morning, Clara was the prey of Mrs. Beckett,Marianne, and the French milliner, and in such a flounced glace silk,such a lace mantle, and such a flowery bonnet was she arrayed, thatLord Ormersfield bowed to her as a stranger, and Louis talked of thetransformations of the Giraffe. 'Is it not humiliating,' she said,'to be so altered by finery? You might dress Isabel for ever, andher nobleness would surmount it all.''If you are not the rose, at least you have lived near the rose,'said Louis. 'You don't fall quite short of the character of MissDynevor.''I wish I were going to school,' said Clara, as they passed alongfamiliar streets; 'then, at least, some one would pity me.'After two hours spent on the railroad, the train entered a districtwith the bleakness, but not the beauty, of the neighbourhood ofmountains; the fresh September breeze was laden with smoke, andstations stood thick upon the line. As the train dashed up to one ofthese, a flag was seen waving, and the shout of 'Cheveleigh,Cheveleigh road!' greeted them.On the platform stood a tall footman, in the most crimson of coats,powdered hair, and a stupendous crimson and white shoulder-knot, auchas Clara had only seen going to St. James's. She would never haveimagined that she had any concern with such splendour; but hergrandmother asked him if the carriage were there, as a mere matter ofcourse, and Jane devolved on him all luggage cares, as coolly as ifshe had been ruling over him all his life.As they issued from the station, a thin, uncertain, boyish cheer rangout, and before them stood a handsome open carriage and four chestnuthorses, with crimson postillions, and huge crimson-and-white satinrosettes.'Wont they all turn to rats and pumpkins?' whispered Clara to Louis.'Bless the poor boy!' cried Mrs. Frost, between laughing and crying,'what has he been about? Does he think I am the Sheriff's ladystill?'The party entered the carriage, and the crowd of little boys andgirls, flymen and porters, got up another 'hurrah!' as the fourhorses went thundering off, with Mrs. Frost apologizing--'PoorOliver's notions were on such a grand scale!--He had been so longabsent, that he did not know how much these things had been disused.'But no one could look at her bright tearful eyes, and quiveringmouth, without seeing that she exulted in her son's affection and hisvictory; and after all it was natural to her, and a resumption of oldhabits.They drove through two miles of brown flat heath, with far-awaymountain outlines, which she greeted as dear friends. Here and therethe engine-house of a mine rose up among shabby buildings, and by-and-by was seen a square church-tower, with lofty pinnacles, amongwhich floated forth a flag. The old lady caught hold convulsively ofClara's hand--'The old church!--My old church!--See, Clara, that iswhere your dear grandfather lies!--My last home!'With brimming eyes Mrs. Frost gazed on it as it came forth moredistinctly, and Clara looked with a sense of awe; but rending heraway from grave thoughts, shouts burst upon her ears, and above themthe pealing crash of all the bells, as they dashed under a splendidtriumphal arch, all evergreens and dahlias, forming the word'Welcome!' and were met by a party on horseback waving their hats,while a great hurrah burst out from the numbers who lined the street.Mrs. Frost bowed her thanks and waved her hand. 'But oh!' she said,almost sobbing, 'where am I? This is not Cheveleigh.'Lord Ormersfield showed her a few old houses that they bothrecognised, looking antiquated in the midst of a modern growth ofnarrow, conceited new tenements. The shouting crowd had, toFitzjocelyn's eyes, more the aspect of a rabble than of a genuinerejoicing peasantry. What men there were looked beer-attractedrather than reputable, and the main body were whooping boys, women,nurse-girls, and babies. The suspicion crossed him that it was a newgeneration, without memories of forty years since, wondering ratherthan welcoming, in spite of arches, bells, and shouts.After another half-mile, a gate swung wide beneath another arch, allover C. D., the F. studiously omitted; and the carriage wheeled inamid a shower of tight little nosegays from a squadron of school-children. They drove up the long approach, through fir plantations,which drew from Mrs. Frost a cry of friendly recognition--for herhusband had planted them; but they had not taken kindly to the soil,and fifty years had produced but a starveling growth. Beyond lay anexpanse of parched brown turf, here and there an enclosure ofunprosperous trees, and full in front stood the wide space ofstuccoed wall, with a great Gothic window full in the midst, andbattlements in the castellated style of the early years of thenineteenth century.No one spoke. After the first glance, Mrs. Frost shut her eyes torestrain the hot tears that arose at the thought of the wintrymorning, when ice-drops hung hoary on the fir-trees, as she haddriven away from the portal, whence music was now pealing forth agreeting, and where Oliver was standing on the very spot where, withclenched hand, he had vowed that all should be restored.Alas! how much was in his power to restore?Gaily-dressed people surrounded the entrance, and, amid triumphantstrains from the band, the carriage stopped, and Oliver held out hishand, saying, 'Welcome home, mother!'She leant forward, kissed his brow, and suffered him to lead her upthe steps to the hall-door, Lord Ormersfield conducting Clara. Atthe door Mrs. Frost paused, to turn, curtsey, and sign her thanks tothe throng who had followed. Her noble aspect and demeanour, so fullof dignity and feeling, obtained a fresh and more genuineacclamation; but throughout there was a strange sense of unreality;she seemed like one performing a part to gratify her son. Claraasked her cousin if it were not like acting a play; and it was plainto him that the spectators beheld it with more curiosity thansympathy.They were a new race. Property had changed hands rapidly in a regionof trade and manufacture, and the old Dynevor name had been forgottenpast recall, amid the very population who were thriving upon theidentical speculations which had swamped Mr. Frost's fortune. If thecrowd without looked like a mob, the assembly within had a parvenuappearance; and as Oliver handed his mother across the hall, hemuttered something, as if he were disappointed both in the number andconsequence of his guests.He led her into a magnificent apartment, all gilding, blue brocade,and mirrors, as far as might be after the model of the days of theShrievalty; but the bare splendour could ill recall the grace andelegance that had then reigned there without effort. Peru had nottaught Oliver taste either of the eye or of the mind, and hisindefatigable introductions--'My mother, Mrs. Dynevor, my niece, MissDynevor, Lord Ormersfield, Lord Fitzjocelyn,' came so repeatedly asquite to jingle in their ears.Sir Andrew Britton, a burly cotton lord, with a wife in all thecolours of the rainbow, seemed to be the grand guest. His ladyseated herself beside Mrs. Frost, and began to tell her, with a toneof patronage, how good a neighbourhood it was, and how much pleasureshe should have in introducing Miss Dynevor.In vain did Mrs. Frost look for a face she knew, and inquire from hernew acquaintance after familiar old names of places and people. Theplaces were either become factories, or some charming new familylived there; and for the people, it seemed as if she might as wellaak for antediluvians; Lady Britton had seldom heard their names, orif any trace survived, they had never been on her visiting list.At last Oliver came up to her, saying, 'Here, ma'am, Mr. Hendersonclaims an early acquaintance with you.''Mr. Henderson!' and she eagerly started up, but looked baffled.'Little George Henderson,' said the grey-headed gentleman--for once areal gentleman--'I assure you I have not forgotten the happy days Ihave spent here.''Little George!' as she took him by both hands--'who would havethought it! You were little George with the apple cheeks. And areno more of you here?'He shook his head sadly. 'They would have been even more glad than Iam to welcome you home; they were older, and knew you better.''Ah! I must learn to ask no questions. And yet, that dear sisterFanny of yours--''Gone many years since, ma'am. She died in India. I hope mydaughter Fanny may put you a little mind of her.''Is she not here?''Why, no. I wished to bring her, but she is but fifteen, and mammawill not trust her out without herself. We are quiet people, and theworld is growing too gay for us.''Clara and I must come to find you out. Can you believe this tallcreature is poor dear Henry's daughter?' as Clara hastened to greether father's playfellow, with an alacrity which piqued Lady Brittoninto a supercilious aside to Lord Fitzjocelyn that the Hendersonswere in poor circumstances, and no one visited them.'And is no one here whom I know? Not one of the old set, George?'asked the old lady, mournfully.'I fear there is hardly any one,' said Mr. Henderson. 'All seem evento me new people. Stay, do you recollect old Mrs. Golding?'After a little confusion, Mr. Henderson's old Mrs. Golding proved tobe Mrs. Frost's young Mrs. Golding; and, on the eager inquiry whethershe were present, ensued the melancholy answer that she was deaf andinfirm, only just able to smile with pleasure at the tidings of herold friend's restoration; and the daughter, whom she could only justbelieve to be grown up, was a worn, elderly woman. Not even the oneheartfelt greeting was without sadness; and Clara likewise met withone solitary satisfaction, and that a very mixed one. Mr. Danvers,the young curate, whom Oliver had not thought worth presenting, washailed by Fitzjocelyn as if their slight Oxford acquaintance had beenan intimacy, and was by him introduced to Clara as belonging toJames's college. She frankly held out her hand, but was discomfitedby his inquiry for her brother, whom he had hoped to meet. Louissaid something about not expecting the schoolmaster abroad in thehalf-year, and Clara was not at all grateful to him for relieving herfrom the embarrassment, but regarded the reply as a shabbyprevarication, and was much inclined to speak out; but Louis wasdrawing the curate into conversation about the population, andhearing but a desponding history. It was interrupted when Oliver,after waiting in vain for more distinguished company, began tomarshal his guests to the grand hall, paved with black and whitemarble, and with a vast extent of wall and window, decked withevergreens, flags, and mottoes. Here a cold collation was prepared,with a band in a music-gallery above, and all the et ceteras dear tocounty papers. Oliver himself handed in Lady Britton, his motherfell to the lot of the Earl, and Fitzjocelyn received orders toconduct a handsome, young, giggling Mrs. Smithers, who, never havingbeen in contact with a live Lord, wanted to make the most of him,and, before she had arrived at her place, was declaring that it was amost interesting occasion, just like a scene at the Opera.Louis glanced back to see what became of Clara, and, finding herfollowing with Sir Andrew Britton, contrived to sit immediatelyopposite to her, at the long, narrow table, with nothing between thembut a couple of cold chickens and a tongue garnished with transfixedcrayfish. His eyes were, perhaps, a greater support to her than evenconversation, for she gathered a little philosophy and charity fromtheir cheering smile and arch twinkling, and she managed to listencivilly to her neighbour, while she saw that her cousin was beingvery polite to Mrs. Smithers. She was a great way from all otherfriends, for the table had been spread for a more numerous assembly,and the company sat in little clusters, with dreary gaps between,where moulds of jelly quaked in vain, and lobster-salads wasted theirsweetness on the desert air. Her uncle could just be seen in the farperspective at the head of the table, and, between him and the Earl,Louis descried his Aunt Catharine, looking bright, with a littleembellishing flush on her withered cheek.Sir Andrew was not a lady's man; and, after he had heard how far MissDynevor had come to-day, that she had never ridden, and had not seenthe Menai tubular bridge, he discontinued the difficult task; andshe, finding that he had not even seen the cathedral, which she hadpassed only fifteen miles off, gave him up, and occupied herself withwatching the infinite variety of affectations which Mrs. Smithers wasplaying off, and the grave diversion with which Louis received them.The lady was evidently trying to discover what had been theintermediate history of Mrs. and Miss Dynevor; and Louis was takingpleasure in baffling her, with cool, quiet answers, especially whenshe came to the question whether Miss Dynevor had not a brother, andwhy he was not present. It appeared that Oliver had made almost asif his mother had been buried and dug up again; involving the thirty-four years of her exile in such utter mystery, that people had begunto make all sorts of wild stories to account for her proceedings; andLord Fitzjocelyn's explanation that she had lived in her own house inNorthwold, and taught him the Latin grammar, seemed quite adisappointment from the simplicity and want of romance.The weary banquet had arrived at ices, and Clara hoped the end wasnear, when the worse trial of speeches began. Mr. Henderson wasdeclaring how strongly he felt the honour which had been devolved onhim, of expressing the universal joy in having so excellent and much-beloved a neighbour restored by the noble exertions of her son. Hesaid all that the rest of the world ought to have felt, and soheartily and sincerely as to make every one imagine the whole thegeneral sentiment, and the welcoming hurrah was cordial and joyous.Mrs. Frost was deeply touched and gratified, and Lord Ormersfieldcongratulated himself on having instigated Oliver to give this toastto Mr. Henderson. If Clara could have driven James from her mind,she would have been delighted, but there could be no triumph for herwhere he was excluded.The Earl returned thanks on behalf of his aunt, and said a great dealthat could have come from the mouth of no one 'unaccustomed to publicspeaking,' ending by proposing the health of 'Mr. Oliver FrostDynevor.' In the midst of 'the fine old English gentleman,' whileLouis was suppressing a smile at the incongruity, a note was broughtto him, which he tossed to Clara, purporting that he was to returnthanks for her. She bent over the table to say, 'You will saynothing I cannot bear to hear,' folded her hands, and shut her eyes,as if she had been going to stand fire.Oliver's clear, harsh tones, incapable of slowness or solemnity,began to return thanks for himself, and pronounce this to be thehappy day to which he had been looking throughout his life--the dayof restoring the family inheritance to his mother, and the child ofhis elder brother; he faltered--he never could calmly speak of Henry.Failing the presence of one so dear, he rejoiced, however, to be ableto introduce to them his only daughter, and he begged that hisfriends would drink the health of the heiress of Cheveleigh, MissDynevor.Never did toast apparently conduce so little to the health of thesubject. Unprepared as Clara was for such a declaration, it was toher as if she had been publicly denounced as the supplanter of herbrother. She became deadly white, and sat bolt upright, stiff andmotionless, barely stifling a scream, and her eyes fixed betweencommand and entreaty on her cousin without seeing, far lessacknowledging, the bows levelled at her. Louis, alarmed by herlooks, saw that no time was to be lost; and rising hastily before anyone was ready, perilled his fame for eloquence by rapidly assuringthe gentlemen and ladies that Miss Dynevor was truly sensible of thekindness of their welcome, and their manner of receiving the toast.Then pushing back his chair, with 'never mind,' to Mrs. Smithers andher scent-bottle, he was at the back of Clara's chair almost beforeher confused eyes had missed him in her gasps for breath, and impulseto do something desperate; and so she might, if his voice had notbeen in her ear, his hand grasping hers, both to console and raiseher. 'Clara, come, take care.' She obeyed, but trembling so muchthat he was obliged to support her. Others would have risen inalarm, but he silenced them by signs, and entreaties that no onewould frighten her grandmother. There was a large glass doorstanding open under the Gothic window, and through it he led her outupon a wide green lawn. She drew her breath in sobs, but could notspeak. Louis asked her to untie her bonnet, and touched the string,which was merely a streamer. This brought a kind of laugh, but sheunfastened the bonnet herself, and the first use she made of herbreath was fiercely to exclaim--'How could you! Why did you not tellthem I never will--''Sit down,' said Louis, gently. 'Let me fetch some water.''No--no--let me get away from this place!' and she almost dragged himalong, as fresh cheers and peals of music broke out, till they hadentered a lonely walk in a sort of wilderness of shrubs. Still shehurried on, till they came out on a quiet little garden, where thetinkling of a little fountain was the only sound; the water lookedclear and fresh with the gold-fish darting in it, and the sun shonecalmly on the bright flowers and wavy ferns adorning the rockwork.'What are you doing, Clara? You must rest here,' said he, drawingher down on a rustic bench, intended to represent a crocodile.'I can't rest here! I must go home! I'm going home to Jem!' sheexclaimed, obeying, however, because, though she could run, she couldnot stand.'Dear Clara,' he said, affectionately, 'it was much worse than Iexpected. I never believed he could have committed himself to suchan open declaration, especially without warning.''I'll not stay!' cried Clara, with all the vehemence of her Dynevornature. 'I'll go straight home to Northwold to-morrow morning--to-night if I could. Yes, I will! I never came here for this!''And what is to become of my poor Aunt Kitty?''She has her Oliver! She would not have me put Jem out of hisbirthright.''James will not be put into it.'She wrenched away her hand, and looked at him with all her brother'sfierceness. 'And you!' she cried, 'why could not you speak up like aman, and tell them that I thank none of them, and will have nothingto say to any of them; and that if this is to belong to any one, itmust be to my noble, my glorious, generous brother; and, if he hasn'tit, it may go to the Queen, for what I care! I'll never have onestone of it. Why could you not say so, instead of all that humbug'!''I thought the family had afforded quite spectacles enough for oneday,' said Louis; 'and besides, I had some pity upon yourgrandmother, and on your uncle too.''Jem told me grandmamma claimed my first duty; but he never knew ofthis wicked plan.''Yes, he did.''Knew that I was to supplant him!''Yes; we all knew it was a threat of your uncle; but we spared youthe knowledge, thinking that all might yet be accommodated, and neverexpecting it would come on you in this sudden way.''Then I think I have been unfairly used,' cried Clara; 'I have beenbrought here on false pretences. As if I would have come near theplace if I had known it!''A very false pretence that your grandmother must not be left aloneat eighty, by the child whom she brought up.''Oh, Louis! you want to tear me to pieces!''I have pity on my aunt; I have far more pity on your uncle.' Clarastared at him. 'Here is a man who started with a grand heroicpurpose to redeem the estate, not for himself, but for her and hisbrother; he exiles himself, he perseveres, till this one pursuit, forwhich he denies himself home, kindred, wife or child, absorbs andwithers him up. He returns to find his brother dead; and thechildren, for whom he sacrificed all, set against him, and rejectinghis favours.'This was quite a new point of view to Clara. 'It is his own fault,'she said.'That a misfortune is by our own fault is no comfort,' said Louis.'His apparent neglect, after all, arose from his absorption in theone object.''Yes; but how shameful to wish James to forget his Ordination.''A strong way of putting it. He asked too much: but he would havebeen, and may yet be, contented with concessions involving nothingwrong. His way of life can hardly have taught him to appreciateJames's scruples, as we do; and even if right and wrong were moreneatly partitioned between them than I think they are, it would stillbe hard on him to find this destined heir spurning his benefits.''What are you coming to, Louis! You think James right?'I would give the world to think so, Clara. One motive is too highfor praise, the other--No, I will say nothing of it. But I couldwish I had not precipitated matters last year.''What, would you have robbed us of our few happy months?''It was your uncle whom I robbed; he would otherwise have come homelike a good genius; but he found you all happy without him, and withno gratitude to spare for him. And there he sits at the head of thatlong melancholy table, trying to bring back days that have gone toofar ever to be recalled, and only raising their spectres in thismocking finery; scarcely one man present, whose welcome comes fromhis heart; his mother past the days of heeding the display, exceptfor his sake; his nephew rejecting him; you indignant and miserable.Oh, Clara! I never saw more plainly money given for that which isnot bread, and labour for that which satisfieth not. Empty andhollow as the pageant was, I could better bear to take my part in it,so far as truth would let me, than tell that poor man that the lastof his brother's children rejects him and his benefits.''At this rate, you will make a hero of Uncle Oliver.''It is because he is one of this world's heroes that he isdistasteful to you.''I don't understand.''Exclusive devotion to one object, grand though it was, has made himthe man he appears to us. Think what the spirit must have been thatconceived and carried out such a design! Depend upon it there is agreatness in him, which may show, when, as dear granny says, she hascured him of all he learnt away from home. I think that must be thework for which you are all brought together here.''But I can't thrust out Jem. I won't stay here on those terms. Ishall protest--''It is not graceful to make an uproar about your own magnanimity, norto talk of what is to happen after a man's death. You don't comehere to be heiress, but to take care of your grandmother. There isno need to disturb the future, unless, to be sure, you were obligedto explain your expectations.''Ah! to be sure, any way I could restore it all to James.''Or, better still, you may yet be able to draw the uncle and nephewtogether, and bring back peace and union.''Then I must stay and bear all this, you think?''As a mere matter of obedience, certainly.'Clara's countenance fell.'That may deprive it of the brilliance of a voluntary sacrifice; but,after all, it is what makes your course safe and plain.''And very dismal, just because no one will believe so.''So the safer for humility,' said Louis. 'Perhaps the dear oldTerrace did not offer training and trial enough. I try to believesomething of the kind in my own case. If choice had been mine, Ishould hardly have been exactly what I am; and you know how my chiefhappiness has been put far from me; but I can imagine that to be atthe summit of my wishes might foster my sluggishness, and that Imight rest too much on better judgment than my own, if it were besideme. Probation maybe safer than joy; and you may do more good toyourself and others than even under Isabel's wing. Only think of themeans in your hands, and all the wretched population round! Therewill be some hope of help for the curate now--besides, I shall knowwhere to come for subscriptions next time I run crazy about anywonderful charity.'Clara smiled. 'I suppose I must bear it,' she said.'For shame, Clara! With Aunt Kitty, who would make a palace of adungeon, in the glorious glow of such a sunset, turning each cloud tored and purple radiance by the very force of love and faith, whocould regret the being beside her? My own dear and precious aunt, tosee her so happy, with bliss and peace so undisturbed, so far abovethese toys, and these distresses, gives me a sort of fear--''Oh, don't, Louis--'They were interrupted by approaching voices. Clara hastily startedup, as her uncle and Lady Britton appeared in the green alley.'Oh, must I go back to them all! My head does ache!'Louis gave her his arm, pursued the path in the opposite direction,and emerged at the lower end of the bowling-green, with thebattlemented front of the house rising before them. Presently, hemet his father searching for him. 'Poor Clara has been overcome,' hesaid, in explanation. 'The speechifying has been too much for her.'It was the first time that Clara had appeared to the Earl in anylight but that of an idle school-girl, and he said, kindly, 'It musthave been very trying. There should have been more preparation.Your uncle would have shown better taste in sparing your grandmammaso obtrusive a reception, and I was much pained both for her and foryou during some of the speeches.'Sympathy from Lord Ormersfield nearly overthrew Clara again, and sheinvoluntarily squeezed Louis's arm. He asked for his aunt, and wastold, 'She is in the house, entertaining these people. They do notknow when to go away. How could Oliver inflict such a party on herand such a style of people!''I must go and help her,' said Louis.Clara was in no condition to appear, but Louis caused Mrs. Beckett tobe summoned, and committed her to her care. Her transport was one ofthe few pleasant things of that day. 'Oh, Miss Clara! Oh, my Lord!Was there ever the like? Isn't Master Oliver the most blessed boy?Missus in her own home again! Eight men, and a French man-cook! Ifever I thought to see the day! Her old room just as it was, onlygrander! Oh, if poor Mr. James was but here!''Ay, Jane, and here's Clara thinking herself ill about Mr. James.Take her up and give her some tea, and make her fit to behaveprettily by-and-by, that granny may not be vexed.'Having seen her safe under Jane's fondling care and infectiousexultation, he betook himself to the drawing-room, relieved hisaunt's anxiety by a whisper, and won golden opinions from the wholecompany, before they were fairly got rid of; and Oliver begged toconduct his mother to her apartment. 'Yes, my dear, I must go topoor little Clara.''I've no fears for Clara,' said Oliver, as he led her upstairs.'Knowing young fellow to wait for my announcement! I can give hernear double what Ponsonby could. I'd not object--old Dynevor blood--''My poor Oliver, you have so learnt to think of money, that you can'tbelieve others live for anything else. You'll learn your mistake.''You think the young chap meant nothing? I shall look sharp afterhim, then. I look on Clara as my own. I'll have no trifling.''You may save yourself the trouble,' said his mother. 'Theyunderstand each other--they have always been like brother and sister,and I cannot have the children teased, or things put into theirheads.'Oliver laughed his scornful chuckle, and said he did not understandthat sort of brother and sister, but happily he became absorbed inshowing his mother the fittings of her splendid bedroom.Clara had the comfort of clinging round her grandmother's neck, andbeing told that it was all nonsense. Jem should have his rights, andUncle Oliver would learn to love and honour him at last; and she wasa good child, and ought to have been prepared, if granny could haveguessed he would do it so publicly and suddenly, but she must forgivehim, for he was beside himself at having got them home again, and hecould not make enough of her because she was poor Henry's child. Soshe saw granny must not be grieved, and she let herself be dressedfor a constrained dinner in the vast dining-room, where the servantsoutnumbered the diners, and the silver covers bore the Dynevor dragonas a handle, looking as spiteful as some of the race could do.Oliver was obliged to conclude that no offer had passed between thetwo young people; but on the way home next morning the Earl observed,'Clara Frost has a fine figure, and is much improved by dress. Sheshows excellent feeling, and does credit to her education.''The Pendragon blood never had a finer development,' said Louis.'Even supposing justice done to poor James, she will have a handsomeportion. Oliver will have far more to dispose of than the fivethousand pounds guaranteed to her.''Poor child!' said Louis.'Yes, I pity her for being exposed to his parading. He forgot thegentleman in his merchant's office. If you should ever have anythoughts of rescuing her from him, my approval would not be wanting,and it would be the easiest way of restoring her brother.''My dear father, if Clara and I were always sister and brother whenshe was poor, we certainly shall be no more now.'Lord Ormersfield mentally execrated Mr. Ponsonby, and felt that hehad spoken too soon.Jane's felicity was complete when, a few days after, she received,addressed in Lord Fitzjocelyn's handwriting, an Illustrated News,with a whole page containing 'the reception of Mrs. Dynevor ofCheveleigh,' with grand portraits of all the flounces and veils, manygratuitous moustaches, something passing for Oliver standing up witha wine-glass in his hand, a puppy that would have perfectly justifiedMr. Ponsonby's aversion representing Lord Fitzjocelyn, and no gaps atthe banquet-table.That picture Mrs. Beckett caused to be framed and glazed, kept it asher treasure for life, and put it into her will as a legacy toCharlotte Arnold.CHAPTER IX.THE GIANT OF THE WESTERN STAR. Come, let us range the subterranean vast, Dark catacombs of ages, twilight dells, And footmarks of the centuries long past, Which look on us from their sepulchral cells. Then glad emerge we to the cheering day, Some sun-ranged height, or Alpine snowy crown, Or Chimborazo towering far away O'er the great Andes chain, and, looking down, On flaming Cordilleras, mountain thrown O'er mountain, vast new realms. The Creation--REV. I. WILLIAMS.The same impression of the Illustrated London News which delightedJane Beckett's simple heart in England, caused no small sensation atLima.Dona Rosita cast one glance at El Visconde there portrayed, and thenbecame absorbed in Clara's bonnet; Mr. Robson pronounced LordOrmersfield as good a likeness as Mr. Dynevor, Mr. Ponsonby cast ascornful look and smile at the unlucky figure representingFitzjocelyn; and not a critical voice was heard, excepting TomMadison's, who indignantly declared that they had made the young Lordlook as if he had stood behind a counter all his life.The juxtaposition of Lord Fitzjocelyn and Mr. Dynevor's niece, wasnot by any means forgotten. It looked very like a gracefulconclusion to Oliver's exertions that he should crown their union,and the county paper, which had likewise been forwarded, very nearlyhinted as much. Mr. Ponsonby took care that the paragraph should belaid in his daughter's way, and he offered her the sight of OliverDynevor's own letter.Mary suspected that he regarded it as something conclusive, and tookcare to read it when there were no eyes to mark her emotions.'Ormersfield and his son were there,' wrote Oliver. 'The young manis not so soft as he looks. They tell me he is going to worksensibly at the estate, and he has a sharp eye for the main chance.I hear he played fast and loose till he found your daughter hadbetter prospects than Miss Conway, whom my fool of a nephew chose tomarry, and now he is making up to my niece. My mother dotes on him,and I shall make no objection--no extravagance that I can see, and hewill take care of the property. You will take no offence, since yourefuse the tender altogether.'Of this Mary believed two sentences--namely, that Aunt Catharinedoted on Fitzjocelyn, and that he was not so soft as he looked, whichshe took as an admission that he was not comporting himselffoolishly. She was quite aware that the friendship between him andClara might deceive an uninitiated spectator; and, though shecommanded herself to think that an attachment between them would beequally natural and desirable, she could not but look with greatsatisfaction at the easy unsuspicious tone of Mrs. Frost's letter,which, after mentioning with much affection and gratitude allOliver's attempts to make her happy, in spite of the many sad changesaround, ended by saying that poor Clara felt the separation from herbrother so much, that without dear Louis she did not know how shewould have gone through the festivities. 'You can guess how he iseverything to us all,' said Aunt Kitty, 'and I brightened up hislooks with giving him your last letter to read. I dare say, MissMary, you would like to scold me.'Aunt Kitty! Aunt Kitty! you dearly loved a little kindly mischief!Let that be as it might, Mr. Ponsonby thought that Mr. Dynevor'sletter had certainly not had much effect, for Mary was more livelyand cheerful than he had seen her since her first arrival. Mary'scheerfulness was becoming the more necessary to him, since he wasbeginning a little to weary of the childish charms of his youngLimenian wife. Rosita had neither education nor conversation; andwhen all her pretty ways had been tried on him in succession, theybegan to grow tedious. Moreover, the playful submission which shehad brought from her convent was beginning to turn into wilfulness.Her extravagances in dress were appalling. She refused to wear thesame dresses twice, and cried, stamped her graceful foot, and poutedwhen he remonstrated. She managed to spend every evening inamusement, either at the Opera, or at evening parties, where hersplendid eyes, and scraps of broken English, made great havoc amongyoung lieutenants and midshipmen visiting Lima. Mr. Ponsonby wasgrowing tired of these constant gaieties, and generally remained athome, sending Mary in his stead, as a sort of guard over her; andMary, always the same in her white muslin, followed Rosita throughall the salas of Lima--listened to the confidences of Limenianbeauties--talked of England to little naval cadets, more homesickthan they would have chosen to avow--and felt sure of some pleasureand interest for the evening, when Mr. Ward came to stand by herchair.One afternoon, as Mary sat in her window reading, a gay voiceexclaimed, 'Beso las manos a Usted;' and looking up, she saw one ofthe prettiest figures imaginable. A full dark purple satin skirtjust revealed the point of a dainty white satin shoe. It was plaitedlow on the hips, and girded loosely with a brightly striped scarf.The head and upper part of the person were shrouded in a close hoodof elastic black silk webbing, fastened behind at the waist, and heldover the face by the hand, which just allowed one be-ringed fingerand one glancing dark eye to appear, while the other hand held a fanand a laced pocket-handkerchief. So perfectly did the costume suitthe air and shape of the lady, that, as she stood among Mary's orangetrees, it was like an illusion, of the fancy, but consternation tookaway all the charm from Mary's eyes. 'Tapada, she cried; 'you surelyare not going out, tapada?''Ah, you have found me out,' cried Rosita. 'Yes, indeed I am! and Ihave the like saya y manto ready for you. Come, we will be on theAlameda; Xavier waits to attend us. Your Senor Ouard will be at hisevening walk.'But Mary drew back. This pretty disguise was a freak, such as onlythe most gay ladies permitted themselves; and she had little doubtthat her father would be extremely displeased at his wife anddaughter so appearing, although danger there was none; since, thoughany one might accost a female thus veiled, not the slightestimpertinence was ever allowed. Mary implored Bosita to wait till Mr.Ponsonby's views should be known; but she was only laughed at for herEnglish precision, and the pretty creature danced away to her stolenpleasure.She came in, all glory and delight at the perplexity in which she hadinvolved the English officers, the guesses and courtesies of her owncountrymen, and her mystification of Mr. Robson, who had evidentlyrecognised her, though pretending to treat her as a charmingstranger.The triumph was of short duration. For the first time, she hadaroused one of Mr. Ponsonby's gusts of passion; she quailed under it,wept bitterly, and made innumerable promises, and then she put on herblack mantilla, and, with Xavier behind her, went to her conventchapel, and returned, half crying over the amount of repetitions ofher rosary by which her penance was to be performed, and thereby allsense of the fault put away. Responsibility and reflection neverseemed to be impressed on that childish mind.Mary had come in for some of the anger, for not having preventedRosita's expedition; but they were both speedily forgiven, and Marynever was informed again of her using the saya y manto.Their minds were diverted by the eager desire of one of the youngofficers to visit the silver mines. It had been an old promise toMary from her father to take her to see them; but in her formerresidence in Peru, it had never been fulfilled. He now wished toinspect matters himself, in order to answer the numerous questionssent by Oliver; and Rosita, eagerly catching at any proposal whichpromised a variety, a party was made up for ascending to the SanBenito mines, some days' journey from Lima. Mary and Rosita were theonly ladies; but there were several gentlemen, three naval officers,and Mr. Ward, who was delighted to have an opportunity of visitingthe wonders which had been, for many years, within his reach withouthis rousing himself from his business to see them. Tents, bedding,and provisions were to be carried with them, and Mary had fulloccupation in stimulating Dolores to bring together the requisitepreparations; while Mr. Ward and Robson collected guides, muleteers,and litters.It was a merry party, seated on the gaily-trapped mules, with an idleyoung midshipman to make mischief, and all in spirits to enjoy hisnonsense, in the exhilaration of the mountain air blowing freshlyfrom the snowy summits which seemed to rise like walls before them.The steaming, misty, relaxing atmosphere of Lima was left behind, andwith it many a care and vexation. Mr. Ponsonby brought his mule tothe side of his wife's litter, and exchanged many a joke in Anglo-Spanish with her and the lieutenant; and Mr. Ward, his browunfurrowed from counting-house cares, walked beside Mary's mule,gathered each new flower for her, and listened to her narrative ofsome of the causes for which she was glad, with her own eyes, to seeTom Madison in his scene of action.The first day of adventure they slept at a hacienda, surrounded withfields where numerous llamas were pasturing. The next began the realmountain work; the rock looked like a wall before them, and the whitesummits were sharply defined against the blue sky. The sharper airmade Rosita shiver; but the English travellers congratulatedthemselves on something like a breeze, consoling them for the glowwith which the sunbeams beat upon the rocks. The palms and hugeferns had given place to pines, and these were growing more scanty.Once or twice they met a brown Indian, robed in a coloured blanket,with a huge straw hat, from beneath which he gazed with curious,though gentle eyes, upon the cavalcade. By-and-by, looking like astring of ants descending a perpendicular wall, Mary beheld a row ofblack specks slowly moving. She was told that these were the mulesbringing down the metal in panniers--the only means of communication,until, as the lieutenant promised, a perpendicular railroad should beinvented. The electricity of the atmosphere made jokes easily passcurrent. The mountain was 'only' one of the spurs of the Andes, amere infant among the giants; but, had it been set down in Europe,Mont Blanc must have hid his diminished head; and the view was betterthan on some of the more enormous neighbours, which were both furtherinland, and of such height, that to gaze from them was 'like lookingfrom an air-balloon into vacancy.' Whereas here Mary had but to turnher head, as her mule steadily crept round the causeway--a legacy ofthe Incas--to behold the expanse of the Pacific, a sheet ofglittering light in the sunshine, the horizon line raised so high,that the first moment it gave her a sense of there being somethingwrong with her eye, before the feeling of infinity rushed upon her.They were turning the flank of the mountain, and losing the sunshine.The evening air was almost chill, and the clearness such that theyalready saw the ragged height whither they were bound rising incraggy shattered grandeur, every flat space or gentler declivitycovered with sheds and huts for the work-people, and cavernous mouthsopening on the cliff-side. Dark figures could be distinctly seenmoving about; and as to the descending mules, they seemed to be closeon the other side of a narrow ravine. Rosita, who, now it came tothe point, was not without fears of sleeping on the bare mountain-side, wanted to push on; she was sure they could arrive before night,but she was told that she knew nothing of mountain atmosphere; andshe was not discontented with the bright fire and comfortablearrangements on which they suddenly came, after turning round a greatshoulder of rock. Mr. Robson and the sumpter-mules had quietlypreceded them, and the gipsying on the Andes was likely to be notmuch less luxurious than an English pic-nic. The negro cook had donehis best; Mary made her father's coffee, and Rosita was waited on toher satisfaction. And when darkness came on, too early for Englishassociations with warm days, the lights of the village at the mineglittered merrily, and, apparently, close at hand; and the starsabove shone as Mary had never seen them, so marvellously large andbright, and the Magellan clouds so white and mysterious. Mr. Wardcame and told her some of the observations made on them bydistinguished travellers; and after an earnest conversation, shesought her matted bed, with a pleasant feeling on her mind, as if shehad been unusually near Louis's world.Clear, sharp, and cold was the air next day; the snow-fieldsglistened gloriously in the rising sun, and a rose-coloured mistseemed to rise from them. Rosita was shown the unusual spectacle ofhoar frost, and shiveringly profited by Mary's ample provision ofwraps. The hill-sides were beyond conception desolate and bare.Birds were an almost unknown race in Peru; and here even green thingshad departed, scarcely a tuft of blossom looking out on the face ofthe red and purple rock; and the exceeding stillness so awful, thateven the boy-sailor scarce dared to speak above his breath. Rositabegan to repent of having come near so horrible a place; and when sheput her head out of her litter, and beheld herself winding along aledge projecting from the face of a sheer precipice, she would havebegged to go back instantly; but her husband spoke in a voice ofauthority which subdued her; she drew in her head into her basket-work contrivance, and had recourse to vows to Sta Rosa of Lima of achaplet of diamond roses, if she ever came safely down again.Mary had made up her mind that they should not have been takenthither if there were any real danger; and so, though she could havepreferred her mule taking the inner side of the ledge, and was nottoo happy when it climbed like a cat, she smiled, and answered allinquiries that she did not think she ought to be frightened. Theregion was in general more stern than beautiful, the clefts betweenthe hills looking so deep, that it seemed as if an overthrownmountain could hardly fill them; but now and then came sudden peepsof that wonderful ocean; or almost under her feet, as if she couldthrow a stone into it, there would lie an intensely green valley,shut in with feathering pines, and the hacienda and grazing llamasdwindled, so that they could have been taken for a Swiss farm andflocks of sheep.Not till the middle of the day did they meet the line of mules, andnot until the sunset did they find themselves close before thewonderful perforated San Benito summit. It was, unlike many othermetalliferous hills, an isolated, sharply-defined mass of rock,breaking into sudden pinnacles and points, traversed with veins ofsilver. These veins had been worked with galleries, which, evenbefore the Spanish conquest, had honeycombed the solid rock, and hadbeen thought to have exhausted its riches; but it had been part ofOliver Dynevor's bold speculations to bring modern science to profitby the leavings of the Peruvians and their destroyers. It was amarvellous work, but it might still be a question whether the profitwould bear out the expense.However, that was not the present consideration. No one could feelanything but admiring astonishment at the fantastic craggy height ofpeaks and spires, rising against the darkening sky, like the verystronghold of the Giant of the Western Star; and, with the blackopenings of the galleries, here and there showing the lights of theworkmen within. Mary remembered the tales, in which Louis usedvainly to try to interest her, of metal-working Dwarfs within themountains; and would have been glad to tell him that, after all,reality was quite as strange as his legends.The miners, Indians and negroes, might truly have been Trolls, as,with their brown and black countenances, and wild bright attire, theycame thronging out of their rude houses, built of piled stones onevery tolerably level spot. Three or four stout, hearty Cornishminers, with picks on their shoulders, made the contrast stranger;and among them stood a young man, whose ruddy open face carried Maryhome to Ormersfield in one moment; and she could not but blush almostas if it had been Louis, when she bent her head in acknowledgment ofhis bow.He started towards her as if to help her off her mule; but Mr.Ponsonby was detaining him by questions, and Mr. Ward, as usual, wasat her rein. In a wonderfully brief time, as it seemed to her, allthe animals were led off to their quarters; and Robson, coming up,explained that Madison's hut, the only habitable place, had beenprepared for the ladies--the gentlemen must be content to sleep intheir tent.'The hut was at least clean,' said Robson, as he ushered them in; andMary felt as if it were a great deal more. It was rudely built, andonly the part near the hearth was lined with matting; the table andthe few stools and chairs were rough carpentry, chiefly made out ofboxes; but upon the wall hung a beautiful print from Raffaelle, ofwhich she knew the giver as surely as if his name had been written onit; and the small bookcase suspended near contained, compressedtogether, an epitome of Louis's tastes--the choicest of all hisfavourites, in each class of book. Mary stood by it, reading thenames, and trying to perceive Louis's principle of selection in eachcase. It jarred upon her when, as the gentlemen loitered about,waiting for the evening meal, they came and looked at the titles,with careless remarks that the superintendent was a youth of taste,and a laugh at the odd medley--Spenser, Shakspeare, 'Don Quixote,'Calderon, Fouque, and selections from Jeremy Taylor, &c.Mary would hear no more comments. She went to the fire, and tried topersuade Rosita they would come safe down again; and then, on theapology for a mantelshelf, she saw some fossils and some driedgrasses, looking almost as if Fitzjocelyn had put them there.She did not see Madison that night; but the next morning he presentedhimself to act as their guide through the wonders of theextraordinary region where his lot had been cast. She found thatthis was only the first floor of the wondrous castle. Above andabove, rose galleries, whence the ore was lowered down to thebuildings here placed, where it underwent the first process ofseparation. The paths above were fit for none, save a chamois, or abarefooted Indian, or a sailor--for the midshipman was climbing aloftin such places, that Tom's chief work was to summon him back, inhorror lest he should involve himself in endless galleries, excavatedbefore the days of Atahualpa.Much of the desperate scrambling which Madison recommended as plain-sailing, was beyond Mr. Ponsonby; but where he went, Mary went; andwhen he stopped, she, though she had not drawn since the master ather school had resigned her, as a hopeless case, applied herself tothe perpetration of an outline of the rocks, that, as she said, 'heraunts might see what sort of place it was.' Her steady head, andfirm, enterprizing hand and foot, enabled her to see the crowningwonder of the mountain, one of the ventanillas or windows. Mr. Ward,having visited it, came back bent on taking her thither; there was nodanger, if she were not afraid. So, between him and Tom Madison, shewas dragged up a steep path, and conducted into a gallery cut out inthe living rock, growing gloomier and gloomier, till suddenly therewas a spot of light on the sparkling floor, and Mary found herselfbeneath an opening through the mountain crown, right up into the sky,which, through the wild opening, looked of the deepest, most ultra-marine, almost purple blue, utterly beyond conception in the glory ofintense colour, bringing only to her mind those most expressive, yetmost inexpressive words, 'the body of heaven in His clearness.' Shefelt, what she had often heard said, that to all mountain tops isgiven somewhat of the glory that dwelt on Sinai. That ineffable bluewas more dazzling than even the fields beyond fields of marvellouswhite that met her eye on emerging from the dark gallery.'I never wish so much that Lord Fitzjocelyn should see anything asthat,' said Tom Madison, when Mary, in her gratitude, was trying tosay something adequate to the trouble she had given, though thebeauty was beyond any word of admiration.'He would--' she began to answer, but the rest died away, onlyanswered by Tom with an emphatic 'He _would_!' and then began thedifficulties of getting down.But Mary had the pleasure at the next pause of hearing Mr. Ward say,'That is a very fine intelligent young fellow, worthy of his library.I think your father has a prize in him!'Mary's eyes thanked Mr. Ward, with all her heart in them. It wasworth going up the Andes for such a sentence to put into a letterthat Aunt Kitty would show to Louis.Robson seemed anxious to monopolize the attention of the gentlemen,to the exclusion of Madison; and while Tom was thus thrust aside,Mary succeeded in having a conversation with him, such as she feltwas a sort of duty to Louis. She asked him the names of the variousmountain-peaks in sight, whose bare crags, too steep to support thesnow, here and there stood out dark in salient contrast to the whitescenery, and as he gave them to her, mentioning the few facts that hehad been able to gather respecting them, she was able to ask himwhether he was in the habit of seeing anything approaching tosociety. He smiled, saying that his nearest neighbours were manymiles off--an engineer conducting some far more extensive miningoperations, whom he sometimes met on business, and an old Spanishgentleman, who lived in a valley far down the mountain side, withwhom he sometimes smoked his cigar on a Sunday, if he felt inclinedfor a perpendicular promenade on a Peruvian causeway for nearly fourmiles. Mary asked whether he often did feel inclined. No, hethought not often; he had generally worked hard enough in the week tomake his book the best company; but he liked now and then to seesomething green for a change after these bare mountains and rocks,and the old Don Manrique was very civil and agreeable. Then, after afew minutes' conversation of this kind, something of the oldconscious abruptness of tone seemed to come over the young man, andlooking down, he said bluntly, 'Miss Ponsonby, do you think therewould be any objection to my coming into Lima just for Christmas?''I suppose not; I cannot tell.'Tom explained that all the miners would be making holiday, and thesenior Cornishman might safely be left in charge of the works, whilehe only wished to spend Christmas-day itself in the city, and wouldbe a very short time absent. He blushed a little as he spoke, andMary ventured to reply to what she gathered of his thought, 'No otherday would suit you as well?''No, ma'am, it hardly would,' he answered, gravely.'I will try what can be done,' said Mary, 'unless you would speak toMr. Ponsonby yourself.'He looked inquiringly at Mr. Ponsonby's figure some paces distant,and shook his head.'I will try,' repeated Mary; and then she added, 'These grand hill-tops and blue sky almost make a church--''Yes, ma'am,' said Tom, his black eyes lighting at the thought; 'I'vefelt so sometimes, but 'tis a mighty lonely one after a time. I'vetaken my book, and got out of earshot of the noise the blacks make;and I do assure you, Miss Ponsonby, the stillness was enough to driveone wild, with nothing but savage rocks to look at either! Not agreen plant, nor a voice to answer, unless one got to the mountainechoes, and they are worse--''But surely you have the Cornishmen! What do they do on a Sunday?''They lie about, and smoke and sleep, or go down to the valley,' saidTom. 'I never thought of them.''I think you should,' said Mary, gravely. 'If you are in anyauthority over them, it must give you a charge over their souls.I think you should, at least, give them the choice of reading theservice with you.''I'll think about it,' said Madison, gruffly.'I will send up some books for them to make an opening,' said Mary.'I should not like to think of men living in such scenes, withoutbeing the better for them.'Robson was here obliged to call Madison to refer some question tohim; but Mary had another talk with him, when he begged to know ifthere were likely soon to be an opportunity of sending to England.He had some fossils which he wished to send to Lord Fitzjocelyn; andhe fetched them, and explained his theories with regard to them as ifhe had almost forgotten that she was not his young Lord. She carriedhis request to her father, and was answered that of course he mighttake a holiday if he could leave the works with safety; he had betterspend a few days in the town when he did come. With this answer shemade him happy; and they set off, to the extreme joy of Rosita, whohad engrossed much less attention than she had expected, and declaredshe would never have come into these horrible places if she couldhave imagined what they were like. Certainly, no one wished to haveher company there again.When Mr. Ponsonby mentioned the permission which he had accorded toMadison, Robson coughed and looked annoyed. Mary could not helpsuspecting that this was because the request had not been preferredthrough himself. 'So the young fellow wants to be coming down, doeshe? I thought his ardour was too hot to last long.''Very natural that the poor lad should want a holiday,' said Mr.Ponsonby. 'It must take a tolerable flow of spirits to stand long,being so many feet above the level of the sea, in caves fit for arobber's den at the theatre.''Oh, I am making no objection, sir,' returned Robson; 'the young manmay take his pleasure for what I care, so he can be trusted not toneglect his business.'Here the path narrowed, and Mary had to fall back out of hearing; butshe had an unpleasant suspicion that Robson was telling her fathersomething to Tom's disadvantage, and she had to consider how to avoidrousing a jealousy, which she knew might be dangerous.Mr. Ward, however, came up to interrupt her thoughts and watch thesteps of her mule. The worst difficulties of the descent hadprecluded all conversation; and the party were just beginning tobreathe freely, think of terra firma as not far off, and gaze witheasier minds on the marvellous ocean. Mary went on in verycomfortable discussion of the wonders they had seen, and of Madison'sremark that the performances of the Incas made one quite ashamed ofthe achievements of modern science--a saying in which Mr. Wardperfectly agreed; and then he began to say something rather long, anda little disconnected, and Mary's mind took an excursion to AuntKitty, and the reading of the letter that she was going to write,when suddenly something in Mr. Ward's voice startled her, andrecalling her attention, she discovered, to her dismay, that he wasactually making her an offer! An offer! She would as soon haveexpected one from her father! And oh! how well expressed--howentirely what it ought to be! How unlike every one of those three ofher past experience!In great distress she exclaimed, 'Oh, Mr. Ward, pray do not--indeed,I cannot!''I feared that I was but too likely to meet with such an answer,'said Mr. Ward; 'and yet your father encouraged me to hope, that incourse of time--''Then papa has told you what he thinks?' said Mary.'I applied to him before I could venture to join this party. Mary,I am aware that I can bring none of the advantages which have'--hisvoice faltered--'which have forestalled me; but the most true andearnest affection is already yours.''I am very sorry for it, Mr. Ward,' said Mary, gravely, though muchtouched. 'It is very kind of you, but it is only fair and candid totell you that papa has probably led you into a mistake. He thinksthat the--the object was weak and unworthy, and that my feelingscould be easily overcome. He does not know--''He assured me that all was at an end--''It is,' said Mary; 'but I am certain that I shall never feel for anyone else the same as'--and the tears were coming last. 'You are verykind, Mr. Ward, but it is of no use to think that this can ever be.''Forgive me for having harassed you,' said Mr. Ward, and they went onso long in silence that Mary hoped it was over, and yet he did not goaway from her. She was sorry to see the grieved, dejected expressionon his good, sensible, though somewhat worn countenance; and sheesteemed him highly; but who could have thought of so unlucky a fancycoming into his head? When, at length, he spoke again, it was to saythat he begged that she would forget what was past, and allow him tocontinue on his former footing. Mary was glad to have somethinggrateful to say, and answered that she should have been very sorry tolose him as a friend; whereupon his face cheered up, he thanked her,and fell back from her rein. In spite of her past trials of thefutility of the attempt to live with a rejected suitor as if nothinghad happened, she had hopes of the possibility when her own heart wasuntouched, and the gentleman nearly doubled her years; but when shetalked to her father, she gathered that it was considered by bothgentlemen that the proposal had been premature, and that her finaldetachment from Louis was reckoned on as so certain that Mr. Ward waswilling to wait, as if it were only a matter of time. He was sowealthy and prosperous, and a connexion with him would have been souseful to the firm, that Mary was grateful to her father forforbearing to press her on what he evidently wished so earnestly.Mr. Ward had exactly the excellent, well-balanced character, whichseemed made to suit her, and she could have imagined being very happywith him, if--No, no--Mr. Ward could not be thought of at the samemoment.Yet, whatever she might say, no one would believe her; so she heldher peace, and wrote her history of the silver mines; and Mr. Wardhaunted the house, and was most kindly forbearing and patient, andMary found at every turn, how good a man he was, and how cruel andmistaken his sister thought her.And Christmas came, when the churches were perfect orange-groves, andthe scene of the wanderers of Bethlehem was acted from house to housein the twilight. The scanty English congregation met in the roomthat served as a chapel in the Consul's house--poor Mary alone of allher household there to keep the feast; and Mr. Ward was there, andMadison had come down from his mountain. There were hearts at homethat would rejoice to hear that.Mary saw him afterwards, and he thanked her for her suggestionrespecting the miners. Two had been only as shy as Tom himself; theyhad been reading alone, and were glad to join company, a third wasbeginning to come, and it had led to a more friendly intercourse.Mary sent him away, very happy with some books for them, some newSpanish reading for himself, an astronomical book, and her littlecelestial globe--for the whole firmament of stars had been by nomeans lost on him. That interview was her Christmas treat. Well forher that she did not hear Robson say, 'That young man knows how tocome over the ladies. I shall keep a sharper look-out after him.I know no harm of him, but if there's one man I trust less thananother, it is one that tries the serious dodge.'CHAPTER X.THE WRONG WOMAN IN THE WRONG PLACE. Give me again my hollow tree, My crust of bread, and liberty. The Town Mouse and the Country Mouse--POPE.The new cook's first compliment to Charlotte was, 'Upon my word, youare a genteel young woman, I dare say you have a lot of sweethearts.'The indignant denial of the Lady of Eschalott was construed into herbeing 'sly,' and Mrs. Cook promised herself to find her out.Those were not happy days with the little maiden. The nurse lookeddown on her, and the cook filled the kitchen with idlers, whose looksand speeches were abhorrent to her. Sometimes the woman took offenceat her for being high; at others, she forced on her advice upon herdress, or tried to draw out confidences either on lovers or theaffairs of the family. Charlotte was sadly forlorn, and shut herselfup in her pantry, or in her own little attic with Jane's verbenaswhich cook had banished from the kitchen, and lost her sorrows inbooks hired at the library. She read, and dreamt, created leisurefor reading, lived in a trance, and awoke from it to see her workneglected, reproach herself, and strain her powers to make up forwhat was left undone. Then, finding her efforts failing, she wouldbe distressed and melancholy, until a fresh novel engrossed her for atime, and the whole scene was enacted over again.Still, it was not all idleness nor lost ground. The sense ofresponsibility was doing her good, she withstood the cook's follies,and magnanimously returned unopened a shining envelope of Mr.Delaford's. At Christmas, when Mr. and Mrs. Frost went to pay avisit at Beauchastel, and the cook enjoyed a course of gaieties, theonly use she made of her liberty was to drink tea once with Mrs.Martha, and to walk over to Marksedge to see old Madison, who wasfast breaking, and who dictated to her his last messages to hisgrandson.James and Isabel spent a pleasant lively Christmas with theirhospitable old friends, and James returned full of fresh vigour andnew projects. His first was to offer his assistance to the Vicar, soas to have a third service on the Sunday; but there were differencesof opinion between them, and his proposal was received soungraciously, that a coolness arose, which cut him off from manyopenings for usefulness.However, he had enough to occupy him in his own department, theschool. He was astonished at his boys' deficiency in religiousinstruction, and started a plan for collecting them for some teachingfor an hour before morning service. Mr. Calcott agreed with him thatnothing could be more desirable, but doubted whether the parentswould compel their sons to attend, and advised James to count thecost, doubting whether, in the long run, he would be able to dispensewith one day of entire rest. This was the more to be considered,since James expended a wonderful amount of energy in his teaching,did his utmost to force the boys on, in class and in private, drilledhis usher, joined in the games, and gave evening lectures on subjectsof general information.Some responded to his training, and these he strenuously encouraged,asking them to dinner and taking them to walk; and these wereenthusiastically fond of him, and regarded his beautiful wife as abeing of a superior order. Fitzjocelyn and James used to agree thatintercourse with her was a very important element in their training,and the invitations were made as impartial as possible, including theintelligent and well-conducted, irrespective of station. Isabel'sfavourite guest was a good, well-mannered lad, son to Mr.Ramsbotham's follower, the butcher, but, unluckily, Mrs. Richardsonand her friends did not esteem it a compliment when their sons wereasked to meet him, and, on the other hand, James did not alwaysdistinguish real merit from mere responsiveness to his own mind.Dull boys, or such as had a half sullen, half conservative dislike tochange, did not gain notice of an agreeable kind, and while intendingto show strict justice, he did not know how far he was affected byhis prepossessions.His lectures had emancipated him from evening parties; and, afterMrs. Frost's departure, visiting gave Isabel little trouble. Thecalm, lofty manners that had been admired in Miss Conway, werethought pride in Mrs. James Frost, and none of the ladies ofNorthwold even wished to do more than exchange morning calls withher, and talk among themselves of her fine-ladyism. She reckednothing of their keeping aloof; her book and her pen were farpleasanter companions on her alternate evenings of solitude, and inthem she tried to lose her wishes for the merry days spent withgranny and Clara, and her occasional perceptions that all was not asin their time. James would sometimes bring this fact more palpablybefore her.The separation of the families had not diminished the income of thehousehold, but the difference in comfort was great. Isabel knewnothing of management, and did not care to learn. She had beenwilling to live on a small scale, but she did not understand personalsuperintendence, she was careless of display, and perfectly happy aslong as she was the guest of the grandmother, but she had nocomprehension of petty tidinesses or small economies. Now James,brought up on a very different scale, knew in detail how thehousehold ought to live, and made it a duty not to exceed a fixedsum. He had the eye for neatness that she wanted; he could notbelieve it a hardship to go without indulgences to which hisgrandmother and sister had not been accustomed. Thus, he protestedagainst unnecessary fires; Isabel shivered and wore shawls; he washurt at seeming to misuse her, resigned his study fire, and stillfound the coals ever requiring to be renewed, insisted that his wifeshould speak to the cook, and mystified her by talking about theregulation of the draught of the kitchen fire; and when Isabelunderstood, she forgot the lecture.He was a devoted and admiring husband, but he could not coollydiscover innumerable petty neglects and wasteful habits. Impatientwords broke out, and Isabel always received them so meekly that herepented and apologized; and in the reconciliation the subject wasforgotten, but only to be revived another time. Isabel was alwaysready to give warm aid and sympathy in all his higher cares andpurposes, and her mild tranquillity was repose and soothing to him,but she was like one in a dream. She had married a vision ofperfection, and entered on a romance of happy poverty, and she had nodesire to awaken; so she never exerted her mind upon the world aroundher, when it seemed oppressive; and kept the visionary James Frostbefore her, in company with Adeline and the transformed Sir Hubert.It was much easier to line his tent with a tapestry of Maltesecrosses, than to consider whether the hall should be covered withcocoanut matting.How Christmas passed with Clara, may be seen in the followingletter:--'Cheveleigh, Jan. 1851.'Dearest Jem,--I can write a long letter to-night, for a fortunatecold has spared me from one of Sir Andrew's dinner-parties. It is areminiscence of the last ball, partly brought on by compunction athaving dragged poor granny thither, in consideration of my unguardeddeclaration of intense dislike to be chaperoned by Lady Britton.Granny looks glorious in black velvet and diamonds, and I do trustthat her universal goodwill rendered the ball more tolerable to herthan it was to me. She, at least, is all she seems; whereas I am soinfested with civilities, that I long to proclaim myself little ClaraFrost, bred up for a governess, and the laughing-stock of her school.Oh! for that first ball where no one danced with me but Mr.Richardson, and I was not a mere peg for the display of UncleOliver's Peruvian jewels! I have all the trouble in the world to beallowed to go about fit to be seen, and only by means of greatfighting and coaxing did I prevail to have my dress only from Londoninstead of Paris.'And no wonder I shivered all the way to the ball. Fancy Janeinsisting on my going to display my dress to that poor dyingMarianne; I was shocked at the notion of carrying my frivolities intosuch a scene, but Jane said her mind ran on it, and it was 'anythingto take off her thoughts from that man.' So I went into her room,and oh! if you could have seen the poor thing, with her short breathand racking cough, her cheeks burning and her eyes glistening at thatflimsy trumpery. One bunch of the silver flowers on my skirt waswrong; she spied it, and they would not thwart her, so she would havethe needle, and the skeleton trembling fingers set them right. Theysaid she would sleep the easier for it, and she thanked me as if ithad really set her more at rest; but how sad, how strange it seems,when she knows that she is sinking fast, and has had Mr. Danvers withher every day. He thinks all is well with her; but it was amelancholy, blank, untaught mind, to begin to work on. Louis wouldcall her life a mournful picture of our civilization. She has toldit all to Jane: she was of the mechanic class, just above the rankthat goes to Sunday-schools; she went to a genteel weekly school, andwas taken out pleasuring on Sunday--no ground-work at all. An orphanat fifteen, she never again knew tenderness. Then came dressmakingtill her health failed, and she tried service. She says, Isabel'ssoft tones made a paradise for her; but late hours, which she did notfeel at the time, wore her out, and Delaford trifled with her.Always when alone he pretended devotion to her, then flirted with anyother who came in his way, and worry and fretting put the finish toher failing health. She had no spirit to break entirely with him,and even now is pining for one kind word, which he seems to be toohard and selfish to send to her, in answer to a letter of forgivenessthat she wrote a fortnight back. What a wretch he must be! Janesays, he tried flirting with poor little Charlotte, and that she wasa little 'took up' with his guitar and his verses; but then, Janesays, 'Charlotte has somewhat at the bottom, and knows better than toheed a man as wasn't real religious.' I suppose that is the truedifference between Charlotte and Marianne, and even if we looked intoDelaford's history, most likely we should find him anothernineteenth-century victim to an artificial life. At least, I trustthat Jane has been the greatest blessing, Marianne herself speaks ofher as more than a mother to her; and I believe I told you of thepoor girl's overpowering gratitude, when she found we would not turnher out to die homeless. We read, and we talk, and Mr. Danverscomes; but I believe dear old Jane does more for her than all.'Poor Jane! when her task of nursing is over, I do not know what shewill turn to. The grand servants only keep terms with her becauseUncle Oliver gave notice that no one should stay in the house who didnot show respect to his _friend_ Mrs. Beckett. It takes all her lovefor Missus and Master Oliver to make her bear it; and her chiefsolace is in putting me to bed, and in airing Master Oliver's shirtand slippers. You would laugh to hear her compassionating the homeminced-pies! and she tells me she would give fifty pounds rather thanbring Charlotte here. My uncle wished grandmamma to manage thehouse, and she did so at first, but she and the servants did not geton well together; and she said, what I never knew her say before,that she is too old, and so we have an awful dame who rules with ahigh hand.'You ask whether the dear granny is happy. You know she is allelasticity, and things are pleasanter here to her than to me, but Ido not think she enjoys life as she did at home. It is hard to haveher whole mission reduced to airing those four horses. We havetormented my uncle out of making us use more than two at a time, bybegging for six and the Lord Mayor's coach; but aired alternatelythey must be, and we must do it, and by no road but what the coachmanchooses; and this does not seem to me to agree with her like trottingabout the town on her errands. There is no walking here, exceptingin the pleasure-ground, where all my grandfather's landscape-gardening has been cut up so as to be a mere vexation to her. Thepeople round are said to be savage and disaffected, and the quarterof a mile between the park and the village is subject to miners goinghome. They did once holloa at me, and orders were issued that Ishould walk no more. I believe that if they saw me fearless, andcoming among them for friendly purposes, they would leave offhooting; but the notion frightens granny, so I am a prisoner. Theyare the people to think it a mockery to be visited by a ladybedizened as I am, and stuck up in a carriage; so we can do verylittle except through Mr. Danvers, and my uncle is alwaysdiscontented at the sight of him, and fancies he is always begging.A little sauciness on my part has the best effect when anything iswanted, for my uncle is very kind to me in his own fashion, which isnot mine.'We have made something of a nest in the last of the suite of rooms,the only one habitably small; but it is wonderful where all the timein the day goes. My uncle likes me to ride with him in the morning,and I have to help granny air the horses in the afternoon; and in theevening, when we are lucky enough to dine alone, I play them bothasleep, unless they go to backgammon. Think of granny reduced tothat! We should be very happy when he is detained in his study, butthat granny thinks it is bad for him. Dear granny!I see the object of her life is to win him back to serious thoughts.She seems to think of him like a schoolboy who must be lured to findhome pleasanter than idle ways; and she begs me quite sadly to bearwith him, and make him happy, to prevent him from longing after hiscounting-house at Lima. She tried to make him promise never to goback, but he has only promised never to go while she lives, and sheseems to think it would be fatal, and to charge all his disregard ofreligious matters upon herself for having sent him out. If you couldsee her pleased smile when we extort a subscription, or when she getshim to church; but when those South American mails come in onSundays--alas! Those accounts are his real element, and his momentsof bliss are over the 'Money-market and City intelligence,' or indiscussing railway shares with Sir Andrew. All the rest is anobstinate and dismal allegiance to the days of Shrievalty, about aseasy to recall as the days when the Pendragons wore golden collarsand armlets. Imitated hospitality turns into ostentation; and thepeople who seek after silver covers and French cookery are no more tomy taste than they are, in good earnest, to Uncle Oliver's. The nicepeople, if there are any, won't come in our way, except Mr.Henderson; and when we do pluck up courage to disgust Mr. Coachman bycalling on Mrs. Henderson, we are very happy. But she is a wisewoman, and will not bring her pretty Fanny into our world; and when Ipress her, behold! I remember what I used to think of patronage.'But Louis has promised to come at Easter, and he will teach me alittle more charity, I hope; and, what is better (no, I don't meanthat), will tell me about the dear, dear, trebly dear Terrace and allthe doings. I hope you will begin your Sunday scheme; but grannyfears the bad set will not care, and the good will prefer havingtheir families together. It is worse than I expected even of Mr.Purvis to refuse the afternoon service, when you offered to take allthe trouble off hishands; granny hopes you will take care what youare about with him. Tell Louis we have a famous letter from Mary toshow him if he will bring us all news of every one, and especially ofhis godchild. Contrary to custom, you tell us more about her thanher mamma does. 'Your most affectionate Sister, 'CLARA.'Before Easter, Charlotte's poor rival was lying at rest in Cheveleighchurchyard, and Jane's task of love was at an end.CHAPTER XI.AUNT CATHARINE'S HOME. The lady sleeps--O may her sleep, As it is lasting, so be deep! Heaven have her in its sacred keep! This bed being changed for one more holy, This room for one more melancholy, Some tomb, that oft hath flung its black And wing-like panels fluttering back, Triumphant o'er the fluttering palls Of her grand family funerals. E. A. POE.The summer was nearly over, when, one morning at breakfast, Louissurprised his father by a sound, half consternation, half amusement,and handed him a note, containing these words:--'DEAR F.,--There were three of us last night; there are five thismorning. Isabel and the twins are doing well. Heaven knows what isto become of us! 'Yours, J. F.''What would you have?' said Lord Ormersfield, calmly. 'The poorerpeople are, the more children they have!'He went on with his own letters, while Louis laughed at theenunciation of this inverse ratio; and then took up the note again,to wonder at the tone of anxiety and distress, so unlike James. Hewent to call on Lady Conway, and was better satisfied to find thatJames had written in a lively strain to her, as if proud of hislittle daughters, and resolved not to be pitied. Of this he was inno danger from his sisters-in-law, who looked upon twin-girls as theonly blessing needed to complete Isabel's felicity, had devised threedozen names for them, and longed to be invited to Northwold to seethem.Nothing was heard of James for more than a week, and, as London grewhotter, dustier, and drearier than ever, Fitzjocelyn longed, morethan he thought wholesome to confess, after Ormersfield turf, thedeep ravines, and rushing brooks. The sun shone almost through theblind of the open window on the large library table, where sat Louisat his own end, writing to his Inglewood bailiff, and now and thensolacing himself by lifting with the feather of his pen one of thebells of a delicate lily in a glass before him--a new spectacle onthe Earl's writing-table; and so was a strip of vellum, withilluminations rich and rare--Louis's indulgence when he felt he hadearned an hour's leisure. There was a ring at the door, a step onthe stairs, and before the father and son stood James, his littleblack bag in his hand, like himself, all dust, and his face worn,heated, and tired.'Then you have not heard from Cheveleigh?' he said, in answer totheir astonished greetings, producing a note, which was eagerlyread:--'Dearest Jem,--My uncle says I may write to you, in case you canleave Isabel, that he will be glad to see you. I told you that deargrandmamma had a cold, and so we would not let her come to Isabel;but I little guessed what was coming. It only seemed a feverishcold, and Jane and I almost laughed at my uncle for choosing to sendfor a doctor. He was not alarmed at first, but yesterday she wasinert and sleepy, and he asked for more advice. Dr. Hastings cameto-day, and oh! Jem, he calls it a breaking up of the constitution,and does not think she will rally. She knows us, but she is almostalways drowsy, and very hard to rouse. If you can come withouthurting Isabel, I know you will. We want you all the more, becausemy uncle will not let me send for Mr. Danvers. Poor Uncle Oliver isdreadfully troubled. 'Your most affectionate CLARA.''Transplantation has killed her--I knew it would!' said James, asLouis stood, with the note in his hand, as if not yet understandingthe blow.'Nay,' said the Earl, 'it is an age at which we could hardly hope shewould long be spared. You could leave Mrs. James Frost withcomfort?''Yes, Miss Mercy undertakes her--she is doing well--she would nothear of my staying. I must go on, the train starts at two,' headded, hastily, looking at the time-piece.'We will send you,' said Lord Ormersfield. 'Take time to rest. Youlook very ill! You should have some luncheon.''No, thank you!' said James, at first with the instinct ofresistance; but yielding and confessing, 'Charlotte went intohysterics, and I had nothing to eat before I came away.'Louis came forward from the window where he had been standing as in adream, he laid his hand on James's shoulder, and said, 'I will go!'His voice was hardly audible, but, clearing it, and striving torecall his thoughts, he added, 'Father, I can be spared. Thedivision is not coming on to-night, or you could get me a pair.'The Earl looked doubtfully at James.'Yes, let me go,' said Louis. 'I must see her again. It has beenmother and son between us.' And, hiding his face in his hands, hehurried out of the room.'Let him come,' said James. 'If duty and affection claim a right,none have such as he.''I hesitate only as to acting unceremoniously by your uncle.''This is no moment for ceremony--no time to deprive her of whatevershe loves best.''Be it so, then. His own feelings are his best passport, and wellhas she deserved all that he can ever feel! And, James, if sheshould express any desire to see me, if I can be of any use insettling matters, or could promote any better understanding with youruncle, I am ready at a moment's notice. I would come at once, butthat many might be burdensome to your uncle and sister.'The two cousins were quickly on their way. James took a second-classticket, the first time he had ever done so in travelling with hiscousin. Fitzjocelyn placed himself beside him without remark.James dozed as well as the narrow seat would permit, and only woke tochafe at each halt, and Louis mused over the associations of thosescenes, and last year's triumphant return. Had the change of habitstruly hastened the decay of her powers? had her son's toil andsuccess been merely to bring her home to the grave of her fathers, atthe expense of so many heartburnings, separations, and dissensions?At least, he trusted that her last hours might be crowned by thepeacemaker's joy, and that she might see strife and bitterness laidaside between Oliver, and Henry's only surviving son.Alas! it was not to be. The shutters and blinds were closed, andClara met them at the door, her pale face and streaming eyesforestalling the tidings. The frame, hitherto so vigorous andactive, had been spared long or weary decay; and tranquil torpor hadmildly conducted the happy, gentle spirit to full repose. She hadslumbered away without revival or suffering, as one who did 'restfrom her labours,' and her eyes had been closed on the previousnight.Clara wept as she spoke, but she had been alone with her sorrow longenough to face it, and endure calmly.Not so her brother. It was anguish to have come too late, and tohave missed the last word and look; and he strode madly up and downthe room, almost raving at the separation and removal which hedeclared had killed her.'Oh, speak to him, Louis!' cried Clara. 'Oh, what shall I do?'As she spoke, the door was opened, and Mr. Dynevor came in, with agrief-stricken look and quieter manner, but his entrance instantlysilenced all James's demonstrations, and changed them into a haughty,compressed bitterness, as though he actually looked on him in thelight of his grandmother's destroyer.'Ah! James,' began his uncle, gently, 'I wish you had been hereearlier!''I left home by the first train after hearing. I ought to have heardsooner.''I could not suppose you would choose to come here without seriousreason,' said Oliver, with more dignity than usual. 'However, Iwould willingly forget, and you will remain here for the present.''I must apologize for having thrust myself on you, sir,' said Louis,'but, indeed, I could not stay away. After what she has been to me,ever since I can remember her--' and tears cut him short.'Sir, it does you honour!' returned Oliver. 'She was attached toyou. I hope you will not leave us as yet.'Louis felt as if he could not leave the house where what was mortalof his dear old aunt yet remained, and he likewise had a perceptionthat he might be a support and assistance to Clara in keeping thepeace between her brother and uncle; so he gratefully accepted theinvitation.Mr. Dynevor presently explained that he intended the funeral to takeplace at the end of the week.'I can not be so long from home,' said James, in a quick, low voice.Clara ran up to her uncle, laid her hand on his arm, and drew himinto a window, whence he presently turned, saying, 'Your sister tellsme that you cannot be so long absent in the present state of yourfamily. If possible, the day shall be hastened.'James was obliged to say, 'Thank you!' but any concession seemed toaffect him like an injury.Grievous work was it to remain at Cheveleigh, under the constantdread of some unbecoming outbreak between uncle and nephew.Fortunately, Oliver had too much on his hands to have much time tospend with the others; but when they were together, there wasscarcely a safe subject, not even the intended names of the twins.James made hasty answer that they had already received their names,Mercy and Salome. Louis and Clara both cried out incredulously.'Yes,' said James. 'We don't like family names.''But such as those!''I wish nothing better for them than to be such another pair offaithful sisters. May they only do as well, poor children!'The end was softer than the beginning, and there was a tight shortsigh, that seemed to burst upward from a whole world of suppressedanxiety and despondence.It was not easy to understand him, he would not talk of home, wasbrief about his little Catharine; and when Clara said something ofIsabel's writings, formerly his great pride, and feared that shewould have no more time for them, his blunt answer was, 'She oughtnot.'These comparatively indifferent topics were the only resource; for hetreated allusions to his grandmother as if they were rending open awound, and it was only in his absence that Louis and Clara could holdthe conversations respecting her, which were their chief comfort andrelief. If they were certain that Oliver was busy, and James writingletters, they would walk up and down the sheltered alley, where Louishad last year comforted Clara. The green twilight and chequeredshade well accorded with the state of their minds, darkened, indeed,by one of the severest losses that could ever befall either of them,and yet it was a sorrow full of thankfulness and blessed hope.Louis spoke of his regret that scenes of uncongenial gaiety shouldhave been forced upon her last year.'I believe it made very little difference to her,' said Clara. 'Shedid just what Uncle Oliver wished, but only as she used to play withus, no more; nay, rather less for her own amusement than as she wouldplay at battledore, or at thread-paper verses.''And she was not teased nor harassed?''I think not. She was grieved if I were set against Uncle Oliver'splans, and really hurt if she could not make him think as she didabout right and wrong, but otherwise she was always bright. Shenever found people tiresome; she could find something kind to say toand for the silliest; and when my uncle's display was most provoking,she would only laugh at 'poor Oliver's' odd notions of doing herhonour. I used to be quite ashamed of the fuss I would make when Ithought a thing vulgar; when I saw that sort of vanity by the side ofher real indifference, springing from unworldliness.''And then her mornings were quiet?''More quiet than at home. While we were riding, she used to sit withher dear old big Bible, and the two or three old books she was sofond of. You remember her Sutton and her Bishop Home, and often shewould show me some passage that had struck her as prettier than ever,well as she had always known it. Once she said she was very thankfulfor the leisure time, free from household cares, and even fromfriendly gossip; for she said first she had been gay, then she hadbeen busy, and had never had time to meditate quietly.''So she made a cloister of this grand house. Ah! I trusted she waspast being hurt by external things. That grand old age was like apure glad air where worldly fumes ccnild not mount up. My only fearwould have been this unlucky estrangement making her unhappy.''I think I may tell you how she felt it,' said Clara; 'I am trying totell James, but I don't know whether I can. She said she had come toperceive that she had confounded pride with independence. She blamedherself, so that I could not bear to hear it, for the grand finethings in her life. She said pride had made her stand alone, andunkindly spurn much that was kindly meant. I don't mean that sherepented of the actions, but of the motives; she said the glory ofbeing beholden to no one had run through everything; and had beenvery hurtful even to Uncle Oliver. She never let him know all herstraits, and was too proud, she said, to ask, when she was hurt athis not offering help, and so she made him seem more hard-hearted,and let us become set against him. She said she had fostered thesame temper in poor Jem, who had it strongly enough by inheritance,and that she had never known the evil, nor understood it as pride,till she saw the effects.''Did they make her unhappy?''She cried when she spoke of it, and I have seen her in tears atchurch, and found her eyes red when she had been alone, but I don'tthink it was a hard, cruel sorrow; I think the sunshine of her naturemanaged to beam through it.''The sunshine was surely love,' said Louis, 'making the rainbow ofhope on the tears of repentance. Perhaps it is a blessing vouchsafedto the true of heart to become aware of such a hidden constitutionalinfirmity in time to wash it out with blessed tears like those.''Hidden,' said Clara, 'yes, indeed it was, even from herself, becauseit never showed in manner, like my pride; she was gracious andaffable to all the world. I heard the weeding-women saying, 'she hadnot one bit of pride,' and when I told her of it, she shook her head,and laughed sadly, and said that was the kind of thing which hadtaken her in.''Common parlance is a deceitful thing,' said Louis, sighing; 'peoplecan't even be sincere without doing harm! Well, I had looked to seeher made happy by harmony between those two!''She gave up the hope of seeing it,' said Clara, 'but she looked toit all the same. She said meekly one day that it might be herpenalty to see them at variance in her own lifetime, but over hergrave perhaps they would be reconciled, and her prayers be answered.How she did love Uncle Oliver! Do you know, Louis, what she was tohim showed me what the mother's love must be, which we never missed,because--because we had her!''Don't talk of it, Clara,' said Louis, hastily; 'we cannot dwell onourselves, and bear it patiently!'It was truly the loss of a most tender mother to them both; bringingfor the first time the sense of orphanhood on the girl, left betweenthe uncongenial though doting uncle, and the irritable thoughaffectionate brother; and Louis, though his home was not broken up,suffered scarcely less. His aunt's playful sweetness had peculiarlyaccorded with his disposition, and the affection and confidence ofhis fond, clinging nature had fastened themselves upon her, all themore in the absence of his own Mary. Each loss seemed to make theother more painful. Aunt Kitty's correspondence was another link cutaway between him and Peru, and he had never known such a sense ofdreariness in his whole life. Clara was going patiently and quietlythrough those trying days, with womanly considerateness; believingherself supported by her brother, and being so in fact by the meresisterly gratification of his presence, though she was far morereally sustained and assisted by Fitzjocelyn. How much happier wasthe sorrow of Louis and Clara than that of James or Oliver! Temperssuch as those in which the uncle and nephew but too closely resembledeach other were soured, not softened by grief, and every arrangementraised discussions which did not tend to bring them nearer together.Oliver designed a stately funeral. Nothing was too much for him tolavish on his mother, and he was profuse in orders for hangings,velvet, blazonry, mutes, and hired mourners, greedy of offers of thedreary state of empty carriages, demanding that of Lord Ormersfield,and wanting James to write to Lady Conway for the same purpose.Nothing could be more adverse to the feelings of the grandchildren;but Clara had been schooled into letting her uncle have his way, andknew that dear granny would have said Oliver might do as he pleasedwith her in death as in life, owning the affection so unpleasantlymanifested; James, on the other hand, could see no affection, nothingbut disgusting parade, as abhorrent to his grandmother's taste as tohis own. He thought he had a right to be consulted, for he by nomeans believed himself to have abdicated his headship of the family;and he made his voice heard entirely without effect, except theindignation of his uncle, and the absence of the Conway carriage;although Lord Ormersfield wrote that he should bring Sir Walter inhis own person, thus leaving James divided between satisfaction inany real token of respect to his grandmother, and dislike togratifying Oliver's ostentation by the production of his baronet kin.Sydney Calcott wrote to him in the name of various former scholars ofMrs. Frost, anxious to do her the last honours by attending thefuneral. Homage to her days of gallant exertion in poverty was mostwelcome and touching to the young people; but their uncle, withouttaste to understand it, wishing to forget her labours, and fancyingthem discreditable to a daughter of the Dynevors, received theproposal like an indignity; and but for Fitzjocelyn's mediation andexpostulations, it would have been most unsuitably rejected. He wasobliged to take the answer into his own hands, since Oliver insistedthat his mother was to be regarded in no light save that of Mrs.Dynevor, of Cheveleigh; and James was equally resolved that sheshould be only Mrs. Frost, of Dynevor Terrace.It was heart-sickening to see these bickerings over the grave of oneso loving and so beloved; and very trying to be always on the alertto obviate the snappings that might at any time become a sharpdissension; but nothing very distressing actually arose until thelast day before the funeral, when the three cousins were sittingtogether in the morning-room; James writing letters.'I am asking Lady Conway to give you a bed to-morrow night, Clara,'he said. 'We shall be at home by three o'clock.''Oh, Jem!' said Clara, clasping her hands to keep them fromtrembling; 'I never thought of that.''You are not ready! That is unlucky, for I cannot come to fetch you;but I suppose you can travel down with Jane. Only I should havethought it easier to do the thing at once.''But, Jem! has my uncle said anything? Does he wish me to go?'James laid down his pen, and stood upright, as if he did notunderstand her words.Clara came up to him, saying, 'I believe I ought to do what he maywish.''I told you,' said James, as if her words were not worth considering,'that you need only remain here on her account, who no longer needsyou.'Louis would have left them to themselves, but Clara's glance sued forhis protection, and, as he settled himself in his chair, she spokewith more decision.--'Dear James, nothing would make me so happy asto go to dear home; but I do not think grandmamma would like me toleave Uncle Oliver.''Oh, very well,' said James, sitting down to his writing, as if hehad done with her; 'I understand.''Dear James! O tell me you are not angry with me! Tell me you thinkI am right!' cried Clara, alarmed by his manner.'Quite right in one point of view,' he said, with acrimony.'James,' said Louis, very low, but so as to make them both start,'that is not the way to treat your sister!''We will renew the discussion another time, if you wish it, Clara,'said James.'No,' said Clara, 'I wish Louis to be here. He will judge for me,'and she spoke clearly, her face colouring. 'It was grandmamma'sgreat wish that I should love my uncle. She used to beg me to bepatient with him, and rejoiced to see us together. She often said hemust not be left with no one to make a home for him, and to go out toLima again.''Did she ever desire you to remain here?''No,' said Clara, 'she never did; but I am convinced that if she hadknown how soon she was to leave us, she would have done so. I feelas much bound as if she had. I have heard her call him my charge.And not only so, but my uncle has never varied in his kindness to me,and when he worked all his life for grandmamma, and my father, itwould be wicked and cruel in me--if he does care for me--to forsakehim, now he has lost them all, and is growing old.''You need not scruple on that score,' said James. 'He has attainedhis object, and made the most of it. He is free now, and he willsoon find a Rosita, if his mines are not sufficient for him.''James, you should not say wrong things,' said Clara.'I am not likely to think it wrong, whatever you may. I have noexpectations. Do not rise up in arms against me, Fitzjocelyn, I donot accuse her. I might have foreseen it. She meant well at first,but the Terrace cannot bear competition with a place like this.Where two so-called duties clash, she is at perfect liberty to makeher choice. It would not be easy to come down to what I have tooffer. I understand. The world will call it a wise choice. Say nomore, Clara, I feel no anger.'She attempted no words; she clasped her hands over her face, and ranout of the room.'James,' said Louis, rising, indignation rendering his voice more lowand clearly distinct than ever, 'I little thought to hear you insultthat orphan sister of yours in her grief. No! I shall not defendher, I shall go to give her what comfort I can. Heaven help her,poor lonely child!'He was gone. James paced about in desperation, raving against Louisfor maintaining what he thought Clara's self-deception; and, in theblindness of anger, imagining that their ultra-generosity wouldconduct them to the repair of Ormersfield with the revenues ofCheveleigh; and, disdainful as he was, it seemed another crueloutrage that his rightful inheritance should be in the hands ofanother, and his children portionless. He was far too wrathful tohave any consistency or discrimination in his anger, and he wascruelly wounded at finding that his sister deserted him, as hethought, for her uncle's riches, and that his own closest friend wasready to share the spoil.In the stillness of the house, the sound of a door had revealed toLouis where to seek his cousin. It was in the grand saloon, wherethe closed shutters availed not to exclude the solid beams ofslanting sunlight falling through the crevices, and glancing on thegilding, velvet, and blazonry upon the costly coffin, that shut herout from the dear tender hands and lips that had never failed tocaress away her childish griefs. At first, the strange broad linesof shadowy light in the gloom were all he could see, but one raytinged with paly light a plaited tress, which could only be Clara'sflaxen hair.She had flung herself, crouching in a heap, on the floor, neverstirring, so that he almost feared she had fainted; and, kneeling onone knee beside her, spoke soothingly: 'My poor little dear Clary,this is the worst of all, but you know it was not Jem who spoke. Itwas only prejudice and temper. He is not himself.'The dim light seemed to encourage Clara to lift her head to listen tothe kind words. 'Was I so very wrong?' she murmured; 'you know Inever thought of that! Will he forgive me, and let me come home?But, oh, granny! and what is to become of my uncle?' she ended, witha sound of misery.'Not here, not now, Clara--' said Louis; 'She is in perfect peace;unhurt by our unhappy dissensions; she is with Him who looks athearts, who can take away all variance.'There was a short space of silence, as the two cousins knelt in thedarkened room, in the sunbeams, which seemed as if they could not yetforsake her who had lived in the light of love.Presently Louis gave Clara his hand to raise her, and led her intothe adjoining room, also dim, but full of sweet fragrant breezes fromthe garden. He seated her on a low couch, and stood by, anxiouslywatching her.'If he had only told me I was wrong!' she sighed.'He could not tell you so, Clara, for it is not wrong, and he knowsit is not. He will thank you by-and-by for not attending to him, nowthat he does not know what he says. He is fairly distracted withthis grief coming upon his home cares.''Cares at dear, dear happy home!' cried Clara. 'Never!''Ah, Clara! I fear that much comfort went away with dear granny.I think he is overtasking himself at the school; and three childrenwithin a year may well make a man anxious and oppressed.''And I have vexed and disappointed him more!' exclaimed she. 'Nowonder he was angry, and ready to impute anything! But he willbelieve me, he will forgive me, he will take me home.''It is my belief,' said Fitzjocelyn, in his peculiar way, 'that theworst injury you could do to James would be to give way to the spiritthat has possessed him.''But, Louis,' cried Clara, wildly astonished, 'I must go; I can'thave Jem saying these things of me.''His saying them does not make them true.''He is my brother. He has the only right to me. If I must choosebetween him and my uncle, he must be mine--mine.''You have not to choose between him and your uncle. You have tochoose between right and wrong, between his frenzy and his truegood.''My brother! my brother! I go with my brother!' was still hervehement cry. Without listening to her cousin's last words, she madea gesture to put him aside, and rose to hurry to her brother.But Louis stood before her, and spoke gravely. 'Very well. Yieldyourself to his management. Go back to be another burden upon ahousehold, poor enough already to sour him with cares. Let him tellyour uncle that both his brother's children loathe the fruit of theself-sacrifice of a lifetime. Transgress your grandmother's wishes;condemn that poor man to a desolate, objectless, covetous old age;make the breach irreconcilable for ever; and will James be the betteror the happier for your allowing his evil temper the full swing?'Clara wrung her hands. 'My uncle! Yes, what shall I do with myuncle? If I could only have them both?''This way you would have neither. Keep the straight path, and youmay end in having both.''Straight--I don't know what straight is! It must be right to clingto my own brother in his noble poverty. Oh! that he should imagineme caring for this horrid, horrid state and grandeur!'Louis recurred to the old argument, that James did not know what hewas saying, and recalled her to the remembrance of what she had feltto be the right course before James's ebullition. She owned it mostreluctantly; but oh! she said, would James still forgive her, and notbelieve such dreadful things, but trust and be patient with her, andperhaps Uncle Oliver might after all be set on going to Peru, andbeyond remonstrance. Then it would all come right--no, not right,for granny had dreaded his going. Confused and distressed by theconflicting claims, Clara was thankful for the present respite givento her by Louis's promise that his father should sound her uncle asto his wishes and intentions. Lord Ormersfield's upright,unimpassioned judgment appeared like a sort of refuge from theconflict of the various claims, and he was besides in a degree, herguardian, being the sole executor of the only will which Mrs. Frosthad ever made, soon after the orphans came under her charge, givingthe Terrace to James, and dividing the money in the Funds between thetwo.Weeping, but not unhopeful--convinced, though not acknowledging it-inly praying for strength and patience, and hungering for one kindword from James--Clara quitted that almost brother, in whose counselhe had constrained her to seek relief, and went to her own chamber,there to throw herself on the guidance of that Friend, who stickethcloser than a brother.The remaining part of the day passed quietly. James did notconsciously make any difference in his manner, meaning to be stillaffectionate, though disappointed, and pitying her mistake, both asto her present happiness and future good.Lord Ormersfield and Walter arrived in the evening, and James appliedhimself to finding occupation for his brother-in-law, whom he keptout of the way in the garden very satisfactorily. The Earl was sosoftened and sorrowful, that Clara hardly knew him. He deeply feltthe loss of the kind, gentle aunt, whose sympathy had been more tohim than he had known at the time; the last remnant of the previousgeneration, the last link with his youth, and he was even moregrieved for the blank she left with Louis than for himself. ByLouis's desire, he inquired into Oliver's intentions. 'Must stayhere,' was the answer. 'Can't leave that child alone with theproperty. I can look to the Equatorial Company here--must do withoutme out there. No, no, I can't leave the girl to her brother; he'dteach her his own nasty, spiteful temper, and waste the property onall those brats. No, I'm fixed here; I must look after Henry'schild, fine girl, good-tempered girl; takes after Henry, don't youthink so?'That Clara took after her father in anything but being tall and fair,would hardly have been granted by any one who knew her better thanthe Earl, but he readily allowed it, and Oliver proceeded:--'As longas she does not marry, here I am; but I trust some one will soon takethe care of her off my hands--man who would look after the propertywell. She's a good girl too, and the finest figure in the wholecounty; lucky him who gets her. I shall be sorry to part with thechild, too, but I shall be working for her, and there's nothing leftthat cares a rush for me now, so I might as well be out of the way ofthe young things. I know the old place at Lima, and the place knowsme; and what do I care for this now my mother is gone? If I couldonly see Clara safe settled here, then I should care as little whatbecame of me as I suppose she would.'The Earl was touched by the dreary, desponding tone of the reply, andreported it to Louis and Clara with such terms, that Clara's decisionwas made at once, namely, that it would be wrong and cruel to castaway her uncle, and be swayed by James's prejudice; and LordOrmersfield told her with grave approval that she was quite right,and that he hoped that James would recover from his unreasonablefolly.'Make Jem forgive me,' said Clara, faintly, as her announcement ofher purpose, when she finally sought her room, obliged to be thoughtmeanly of, rather than do ill, denying her fondest affections,cutting herself off from all she loved, and, with but thisconsolation, that she was doing as grandmamma would have bidden her.Oh, how her heart yearned after home!On the morrow, Clara sorrowed in her solitary chamber alone withfaithful Jane, who, amid her bursts of tears, felt the onesatisfaction, that her dear mistress had lived to be buried like thestock she came of, and who counted the carriages and numbered thescarfs, like so many additional tributes from the affection of herdear Master Oliver.Once on that day James was visibly startled from his heavy, sternmood of compressed, indignant sorrow. It was as he advanced to theentrance of the vault, and his eye was struck by a new and veryhandsome tablet on the wall. It was to the father, mother, and youngbrother and sisters, whose graves had been hastily made far away inthe time of the pestilence, the only Dynevors who did not lie in thetombs of their fathers. For one moment James moved nearer to hisuncle. Could he have spoken then, what might not have followed? butit was impossible, and the impulse passed away.But he was kind when he hurried upstairs for a last embrace to Clara.He still felt fondly, brotherly, and compassionate; and all the more,because she had proved more weak against temptation than he hadexpected. His farewell was, 'Good-bye, my poor Clara, God blessyou.''Oh, thank you!' cried Clara, from the bottom of her heart. 'Youforgive me, James?''I forgive; I am sorry for you, my poor child. Mind, Dynevor Terraceis still your home, if you do not find the happiness you expect inyour chosen lot.''Happiness!' but he had no time to hear. He was gone, while shesobbed out her message of love for Isabel, and Louis ran up, palewith repressed suffering, and speaking with difficulty, as he wrungher hand, and murmured, 'Oh, Clara! may we but abide patiently.'After his good-bye, he turned back again to say, 'I'm selfish; butlet me put you in mind not to let the Lima correspondence drop.''Oh, no, no; you know I won't.''Thank you! And let me leave you Mary's keynote of comfort, 'Committhy way unto the Lord, and He will bring it to pass.'''Thank you,' said Clara, in her turn, and she was left alone.CHAPTER XII.THE FKOST HOUSEHOLD. The wind of late breathed gently forth, Now shifted east, and east by north, Bare trees and shrubs but ill, you know, Could shelter them from rain or snow, Stepping into their nests they paddled, Themselves were chilled, their eggs were addled, Soon every father bird and mother Grew quarrelsome, and pecked each other. Pairing Time Anticipated-COWPER.Three weeks longer did the session drag on, but on the joyful daywhen release was given, Lord Ormersfield was surprised to find Mr.Dynevor's card upon his table, with an address at Farrance's hotel.Louis alone was at leisure to repair thither. He found Clara alone,looking as if her grief were still very fresh, and, though strivingto speak gaily, the tears very near the surface.'We are going abroad,' she said; 'Uncle Oliver thinks it a part of myeducation, and declares he will not have me behind the Miss Brittons.We are bound straight for Switzerland.''Lucky girl,' said Louis.'I'm sure I don't care for it,' said Clara; 'mountains and picturesare not a bit in my line, unless I had Isabel and you, Louis, to makeme care.''Learn, then,' said Louis; 'it shows that your education isdefective. Yes, I see,' he continued, as Clara signed heavily, 'butyou don't know the good it will do you to have your mind forciblyturned aside.''If I could only sit quiet in a corner,' said Clara.'So you will, in many a corner of a railway carriage.'She smiled a little. 'The truth is,' she said, 'that poor UncleOliver cannot be quiet. I can't see what pleasure Italy will be tohim, but he is too miserable at home. I never saw such restlessunhappiness!' and her eyes filled with tears. 'Oh, Louis! I am gladyou would not let me say anything about leaving him. Sometimes whenhe bids me good night, he puts his arm round me, and says sopitifully that I do not care for him. Do you know, I think mine isthe little spar of love that he tries to cling to in the great shipwreck; and I feel quite sorry and hypocritical that it is such apoor, miserable shred.''It will grow,' said Louis, smiling.'I don't know; he is terribly provoking sometimes--and without deargranny to hinder the rubs. O, Louis! it is true that there is nobearing to stay at home in those great empty rooms!''And Jane?''Oh, she goes,' said Clara, recovering a smile; 'she is firmlypersuaded that we shall run into another revolution, and as she couldnot frighten us by the description of your wounds, she decides tocome and dress ours when we get any. Dear old Jenny, I am glad shegoes; she is the only creature I can talk to; but, Louis, before myuncle comes in, I have something to give you.'It was the letters that Mary had written to her aunt since theparting, and the Spanish books which she had left in her charge.'It is very kind in you, Clara,' said Louis, fervently.They talked of Mary, and a little of James, from whom Clara had onceheard; but it had been a stiff letter, as if a barrier were betweenthem, and then Mr. Dynevor came in, and seemed pleased to find Louisthere; even asking him whether he could not join them on their tour,and help Clara to speak French.'No, thank you, sir,' said Louis, 'I am afraid my company brought nogood luck last time.''Never mind that--manage better now--ha, Clara.''It would be very nice; but he has a great deal too much to do athome,' said Clara.Oliver would not be persuaded that Fitzjocelyn would not meet themabroad, and began magniloquently talking of his courier, and hisroute, and while he was looking for the map, the two cousins smiled,and Clara said,--'Lucky you to have work at home, and to stay withit.''Only I say, Clara, when you break down anywhere, send me atelegraph.''No such good luck,' sighed Clara.'So he won't come,' said her uncle, when he was gone; 'but we shallhave him following us yet--Ha! ha! Never mind, Clara.'Clara laughed. She knew what her uncle meant, but the notion was toher too impossible and ridiculous even to need a blush. She did notthink the world contained Louis's equal; but she had always knownthat his love was disposed of, and she no more thought of wishing forit than for any other impossible thing. His affection for Mary gaveher no more pain than did that of James for Isabel; and she wouldhave treated with scorn and anger anything that impeached hisconstancy. The pleasure with which he received Mary's letters wasthe single satisfaction that she carried away with her.And so she was borne away, and her sad heart could not choose but besomewhat enlivened by change and novelty, while her uncle made it hisbusiness to show her everything as rapidly as it could be seen,apparently with no relish himself for aught but perpetual movement.So passed the autumn with Clara. It was not much brighter at DynevorTerrace. Clara, being still under age, had it not in her power toresign her half of her grandmother's income, even if her brotherwould have accepted it; and 70 pounds made a difference in such anincome as James's, more especially as his innovations did not tend tofill the school.Murmurs were going about that Mr. Frost was severe, or that he waspartial. Some censured his old opinions, others his new studies; onehad been affronted by being almost told his boy was a dunce, anotherhated all this new-fangled nonsense. The ladies were all, to awoman, up against his wife, her airs, her poverty, her twins, and herhousekeeping; and seldom spoke of her save to contrast her with goodold Mrs. Frost. And then it was plain that something was wrongbetween him and his uncle, and no one could believe but that histemper had been the cause. The good Miss Faithfulls struggled invain to silence scandal, and keep it from 'coming round;' and luckilyIsabel was the last person likely either to hear or resent.The boys met with decreased numbers after the holidays; and Jamesreceived them with undiminished energy, but with failing patience,and a temper not improved by the late transactions at Cheveleigh, andfretted, as Louis had divined, by home cares.Of all living women, Isabel was one of the least formed by habits oreducation to be an economical housewife and the mother of twins.Maternal love did not develop into unwearied delight in infantcompanionship, nor exclusive interest in baby smiles; and while shehad great visions for the future education of her little maidens, shewas not desirous to prolong the time spent in their society, but ingeneral preferred peace and Sir Hubert. On the other hand, James wasan unusually caressing father. After hours among rough inattentiveboys, nothing rested him so much as to fondle those tender creatures;his eldest girl knew him, and was in ecstasy whenever he approached;and the little pair of babies, by their mere soft helplessness, gavehim an indescribable sense of fondness and refreshment. His littleones were all the world to him, and he could not see how a patternmother should ever be so happy as with them around her. He forgotthe difference between the pastime of an hour and the employment of aday. The need of such care on her part was the greater since thenursery establishment was deficient. The grand nurse had almostabdicated on the double addition to her charge, and had only beenbribed to stay by an ill-spared increase in wages, and a share in anunderling, who was also to help Charlotte in her housemaid'sdepartment. Nevertheless, the nurse was always complaining; thechildren, though healthy, always crying, and their father alwayscertain it was somebody's fault. Nor did the family expensesdiminish, retrench his own indulgences as he might. It was themistress's eye that was wanting, and Isabel did not know how to useit. The few domestic cares that she perceived to be her duty weregone through as weary tasks, and her mind continued involved in herown romantic world, where she was oblivious of all that wastroublesome or vexatious. Now and then she was aware of a sluggishdulness that seemed to be creeping over her higher aspirations--awant of glow and feeling on religious subjects, even in the mostsacred moments; and she wondered and grieved at a condition, such asshe had never experienced in what she had thought far more untowardcircumstances. She did not see the difference between doing her bestwhen her will was thwarted, and her present life of neglect andindulgence. Nothing roused her; she did not perceive omissions thatwould have fretted women of housewifely instincts, and her softdignity and smooth temper felt few annoyances; and though James couldsometimes be petulant, he was always withheld from reproving her bothby his enthusiastic fondness, and his sense that for him she hadquitted her natural station of ease and prosperity.On a dark hazy November afternoon, when the boys had been unusuallyobtuse and mischievous, and James, worn-out, wearied, and uncertainwhether his cuts had alighted on the most guilty heads, strode homewith his arm full of Latin exercises, launched them into the study,and was running up to the drawing-room, when he almost fell overCharlotte, who was scouring the stairs.She gave a little start and scream, and stood up to let him pass. Hewas about to rebuke her for doing such work at such an hour; but hesaw her flushed, panting, and evidently very tired, and his wrath wasaverted. Hurrying on to the drawing-room, he found Isabel eagerlywriting. She looked up with a pretty smile of greeting; but he onlyran his hand through his already disordered hair, and exclaimed--'Our stairs are like the Captain of Knockdunder's. You never knowthey are cleaned, except by tumbling over the bucket and the maid.''Are they being done?' said Isabel, quietly. 'I suppose the maidswere busy this morning.''And Charlotte, too! She looks half dead. I thought Ellen was to dosuch work, and ought to have done it in proper time.''Little Catharine is so fretful, that Ellen cannot be spared from thenursery.''I suppose she might be, if you were not absorbed in that writing.''I had the children with me, while the servants were at dinner; butKitty was so troublesome, that I could not keep her. I amparticularly anxious to finish this.''Some people would think a sick child more engrossing than that--' Hehad very nearly said trash, but he broke off short.'There is nothing really the matter with her,' began Isabel,composedly; but James did not wait to listen, and muttering, 'Thatgirl will be killed if she goes on,' he ran up to the nursery, whencehe already heard a sound of low fretting.The child was sitting on the nurse's lap, with a hot red spot on onecheek, teased and disturbed by the noises that the lesser ones wereconstantly making, as one lay in her cot, and the other was carriedabout by the girl. As he entered, she shrieked joyously, andstretched out her arms, and Kitty was at once clinging, hugging roundhis neck. Sending Ellen down to finish the stairs, he carried offthe little girl, fondling and talking to her, and happy in herperfect content. But he did not go to the drawing-room. 'No, no,mamma must not be interrupted,' he bitterly thought, as he carriedher down to the fireless study, hung his plaid round himself and her,and walked up and down the room with her, amusing her till she fellinto a slumber on his shoulder.Isabel could not at once resume her pen. Her even temper was foronce ruffled, and her bosom swelled at the thought that his reproachwas unjust; she was willing to do what was fitting, and he ought notto expect her to be an absolute nursery-maid. Women must keep up thetone of their own minds, and she might be being useful to the worldas well as to her own family. If he wanted a mere household drudge,why had he not looked elsewhere? Up went her queenly head, as shebelieved her powers were meant for other things; but her heart gave apainful throb at the recollection that poverty had been her voluntarychoice, and had seemed perfect felicity with James. Alas! she loved,honoured, and admired him, as her upright, unselfish, uncompromisinghusband, but worries, and rebukes, and tart answers, had made many arent in the veil in which her fancy had enfolded him. Sir Roland haddisappeared, and James and Sir Hubert were falling farther andfarther asunder.And Isabel sighed, partly at the memory of the imaginary being forwhom she had taken James, and partly at the future prospect, thenarrow sphere, the choice between solitude and dull society, thehomely toils that must increase, worn-out garments, perpetualalphabets, children always whining, and James always irritated,thinking her remiss, and coming in with that furrow on his forehead,and his hair standing up wildly. She shrank from the contemplation,took her letter-case on her knee, moved close to the fire to profitby the light, stirred up a clear flame, and proceeded with thebenevolent hermit, who came to the rescue when Sir Hubert was at thelast gasp, and Adeline had received his beautiful resigned words.The hermit had transported him into his hut, and comforted Adeline,and was beginning a consolatory harangue, making revelations thatwere to set everything right, when just as he had gone as far as 'Myson, know that I did not always wear this amice,' there was a tap atthe door, and she saw Fitzjocelyn, who had been at Oakstead for thelast few weeks, attending to some matters connected with hisconstituency.'Ah! is it you?' she said, her lap too full of papers for her torise. 'I did not know you were come home.''I came yesterday; and what company do you think I had in the trainas far as Estminster?''Ah, I can guess! How does Louisa look?''Rather languid; but Estminster is to work wonders. She declaresthat Northwold is her best cure, and I am speculating whether shewill prevail. I think Lady Conway dreads your example.''Mamma does not allow for the force of imagination,' said Isabel, notexactly knowing what prompted either the words or the sigh.'I am come to ask if you will kindly give me a dinner. My father isgone to the book-club meeting, so I thought we would try to reviveold times,' he said, smiling, but sadly, for the present scene waslittle like the No. 5 of old times.'We shall be delighted,' said Isabel, with alacrity, relieved atavoiding a tete-it-tete with her husband at present, and refreshed bythe sight of one belonging to her former life, and external to herpresent round of monotonous detail. 'Fortunately, it is not alecture night and James will be very glad.'I suppose he ia not come in from school?''Yea, he is. I think he is in the study. I will let him know,' shesaid, with her hand on the bell.'I will go to him,' said Louis, departing out of consideration thatshe might wish for space to attend to dinner, room, and dress. Thetwo last were scarcely in such a state as he had been used to see atNo. 5: books were on the sofa, the table-cover hung awry; the DresdenShepherd's hat was grimed, and his damsel's sprigged gown hemmed withdust; there were no flowers in the vases, which his aunt had neverleft unsupplied; and Isabel, though she could not be otherwise thanhandsome and refined, had her crape rumpled, and the heavy folds ofher dark hair looking quite ready for the evening toilette; and, asshe sat on her low seat by the fire, the whole had an indescribableair of comfort passing into listless indulgence.Fitzjocelyn politely apologized to Ellen for a second time steppingover her soapy deluge, and, as he opened the study door with apreliminary knock, a voice, as sharp and petulant as it was low,called out, 'Hollo! Be quiet there, can't you! You've no businesshere yet, and I have no time to waste on your idleness.''I am sorry to hear it,' said Louis, advancing into the dim light ofthe single bed-room candle, which only served to make visible thedusky, unshuttered windows, and the black gulf of empty grate. Jameswas sitting by the table, with his child wrapped in the plaid, asleepon his breast, and his disengaged hand employed in correctingexercises. Without moving, he held it out, purple and chilled,exclaiming, 'Ha! Fitzjocelyn, I took you for that lout of a Garett.''Is this an average specimen of your reception of your scholars?''I was afraid of his waking the child. She has been unwell all day,and I have scarcely persuaded her to go to sleep.''Emulating Hooker.''As little in patience as in judgment,' sighed James.'And which of them is it who is lulled by the strains of 'As inproesenti?'''Which?' said James, somewhat affronted. 'Can't you tell sixteenmonths from five?''I beg her pardon; but I can't construct a whole child from an inchof mottled leg--as Professor Owen would a megalosaurus from a tooth.Does she walk?''Poor child, she _must_!' said James. 'She thinks it very hard tohave two sisters so little younger than herself,' and he peeped underthe plaid at the little brown head, and drew it closer round, with alook of almost melancholy tenderness, guarding carefully againsttouching her with his cold hands.'She will think it all the better by-and-by,' said Louis.'You had better not stay here in the cold. I'll come when I haveheard that boy's imposition and looked over these exercises.' And heran his hand through his hair again.'Don't! You look like enough to a lion looking out of a bush tofrighten ten boys already,' said Louis. 'I'll do the exercises,'pulling the copy-books away.'What, you don't trust me?' as James detained them.'No, I don't,' said James, his cousin's brightness awakening hislivelier manner. 'It needs an apprenticeship to be up to theirblunders.''Let me read them to you. I gave notice to Isabel that I am come todinner, and no doubt she had rather I were disposed of.'James objected no farther, and the dry labour was illuminated by thediscursive remarks and moralizings which Louis allowed to flow intheir natural idle course, both to divert his dispirited cousin, andto conceal from himself how much cause there was for depression.When the victim of the imposition approached, Louis prevented thedreaded clumsy entrance, seized on a Virgil, and himself heard thefifty lines, scarcely making them serve their purpose as apunishment, but sending the culprit away in an unusually amiabletemper.Services from Louis were too natural to James to be requited withthanks; but he was not uncivil in his notice of a wrong tense thathad been allowed to pass, and the question was argued with aneagerness which showed that he was much enlivened. On the principlethat Louis must care for all that was his, as he rose to take thestill-sleeping child upstairs, he insisted that his cousin shouldcome with him, if only for the curiosity of looking at the other twolittle animals, and learning the difference between them and Kitty,at whom he still looked as if her godfather had insulted her.It was pretty to see his tenderness, as he detached the little girlfrom her hold, and laid her in the cot, making a little murmuringsound; and boasted how she would have shown off if awake, and laughedover her droll little jealousies of his even touching the twins. Asshe was asleep, he might venture; and it was comical to hear himdeclaring that no one need mistake them for each other, and to seehim trying to lay them side by side on his knees to be compared, whenthey would roll over, and interlace their little scratching fingers;and Louis stood by teasing him, and making him defend their beauty interms that became extravagant. He was really happy here; thecareworn look smoothed away, the sharpness left his tones, and therewas nothing but joyous exultation and fondness in his whole manner.The smile did not last long, for Louis was well-nigh throwndownstairs by a dustpan in a dark corner, and James was heardmuttering that nothing in that house was ever in its right place; andwhile Louis was suggesting that it was only himself who was not inthe right place, they entered the drawing-room, which, like the lady,was in the same condition as that in which he had left it. SinceIsabel had lost Marianne and other appliances, she had thought it notworth while to dress for dinner; so nothing had happened, except thatthe hermit had proved to be Adeline's great uncle, and had begun toclear up the affair of the sacrilege.He was reluctant to leave off when the gentlemen appeared; but Isabelshut him up, and quietly held out the portfolio to James, who put iton the side-table, and began to clear the books away and restore somesort of order; but it was a task beyond his efforts.Dinner was announced by Charlotte, as usual, all neat grace andsimplicity, in her black dress and white apron, but flushed andheated by exertions beyond her strength. All that depended on herhad been well done; but it would not seem to have occurred to hermistress that three people ate more than two; and to Louis, who hadbeen too busy to take any luncheon, the two dishes seemed alarminglysmall. One was of haricot mutton, the other of potatoes; andCharlotte might be seen to blush as she carried Lord Fitzjocelyn theplate containing a chop resembling Indian rubber, decorated withgrease and with two balls of nearly raw carrot, and followed it upwith potatoes apparently all bruises.Louis talked vigorously of Virginia and Louisa--secretly marvellinghow his hosts had brought themselves down to such fare. Isabel wasdining without apparently seeing anything amiss, and James attemptednothing but a despairing toss of his chin, as he pronounced thecarrots underdone. After the first course there was a long interval,during which Isabel and Louis composedly talked about the publicmeeting which he had been attending, and James fidgetted in thenervousness of hardly-restrained displeasure; but suddenly afrightful shrieking arose, and he indignantly cried, 'That girl!''Poor Charlotte in her hysterics again,' said Isabel, moving off,quickly for her, with the purple scent-bottle at her chatelaine.'Isabel makes her twice as bad,' exclaimed James; 'to pet her witheau-de-Cologne is mere nonsense. Some day I shall throw a bucket ofcold water over her.'Isabel had left the door open, and they heard her softly comfortingCharlotte with 'Never mind,' and 'Lord Fitzjocelyn would not care,'till the storm lulled. Charlotte crept off to her room, and Isabelreturned to the dinner-table.'Well, what's the matter now?' said James.'Poor Charlotte!' said Isabel, smiling; 'it seems that she trusted tomaking a grand appearance with the remains of yesterday's pudding,and that she was quite overset by the discovery that Ellen and MissCatharine had been marauding on them.''You don't mean that Kitty has been eating that heavy pudding at thistime of night?' cried James.'Kitty eats everything,' was the placid answer, 'and I do not thinkwe can blame Ellen, for she often comes down after our dinner to findsomething for the nursery supper.''Things go on in the most extraordinary manner,' muttered James.'I suppose Charlotte misses Jane,' said Louis. 'She looks ill.''No wonder,' said James, 'she is not strong enough for such work.She has no method, and yet she is the only person who ever thinks ofdoing a thing properly. I wish your friend Madison would come homeand take her off our hands, for she is always alternating betweenfits of novel-reading and of remorse, in which she nearly worksherself to death with running after lost time.''I should be sorry to part with her,' said Isabel; 'she is so quiet,and so fond of the children.''She will break down some day,' said James; 'if not before, certainlywhen she hears that Madison has a Peruvian wife.''There is no more to come,' said Isabel, rising; 'shall we comeupstairs?'James took up the candles, and Louis followed, considerably hungry,and for once provoked by Isabel's serene certainty that nobody caredwhether there were anything to eat. However, he had forgotten all bythe time he came upstairs, and began to deliver a message from LadyConway, that she was going to write in a day or two to beg for avisit from Isabel during her sojourn at Estminster, a watering-placeabout thirty miles distant. Isabel's face lighted with pleasure.'I could go?' she said, eagerly turning towards James.'Oh, yes, if you wish it,' he answered, gruffly, as if vexed at hergratification.'I mean, of course, if you can spare me,' she said, with an air ofmore reserve.'If you wish it, go by all means. I hope you will.''The Christmas holidays are so near, that we may both go,' saidIsabel; but James still had not recovered his equanimity, and Louisthought it best to begin talking of other things; and, turning toJames, launched into the results of his Inglewood crops, and thegrand draining plan which was to afford Marksedge work for thewinter, and in which his father had become much interested. But hedid not find that ready heed to all that occupied him of which heused to be certain at the Terrace. Isabel cared not at all forfarming, and took no part in 'mere country squire's talk;' and Jameswas too much overburthened with troubles and anxieties to enterwarmly into those of others. Of those to whom Louis's concerns hadbeen as their own, one had been taken from him, the other two werefar away; and the cold 'yes,' 'very good,' fell coldly on his ear.The conversation reverted to the school; and here it appeared thattwo years' experience had taken away the freshness of novelty, andthe cycle of disappointment had begun. More boys were quitting theschool than the new-comers could balance; and James spoke with acutevexation of the impracticability of the boys, and the folly of theparents. The attendance at his evening lectures had fallen off; andhe declared that there was a spirit of opposition to whatever he did.The boys disobeyed, knowing that they should be favoured at home, andif they were punished, the parents talked of complaints to thetrustees. The Sunday teaching was treated as especially obnoxious:the genteel mothers talked ridiculously about its resembling acharity-school, the fathers did not care whether their sons went ornot, and he had scarcely five boys who appeared there regularly, andof them one was the butcher's son, who came rather in spite of hisparents than with their consent. Attendance at church was more slackthan ever; and when he lectured the defaulters, and gave themadditional tasks in the week, it was resented as an injustice. Tocrown all, Mr. Ramsbotham had called, and had been extremely insolentabout a boy whose ears had been boxed for reading Pickwick in school,under cover of his Latin grammar, and Isabel was almost indignantwith Miss Faithfull for having ventured to hint to her that shewished Mr. Frost would be a little more gentle with the boys.Isabel was fully alive now, and almost as vehement as her husband, inher complaints against his many foes. There was no lack of sympathyhere, indeed, there might be rather too much, for she did not affordthe softening influence that James had hitherto found at home.'Well, Jem,' said Louis, at last, 'I think you should keep your handsoff the boys.''You are not bitten with the nonsense about personal dignity andcorporal punishment?' said James.'By no means. I have an infinite respect for the great institutionof flogging; but a solemn execution is one thing, a random strokeanother.''Theories are very good things till you come to manage two scoredunces without sense or honour. There is only one sort of appeal totheir feelings that tells.''Maybe so, but I have my doubts whether you are the man to make it.'Louis was sorry he had so spoken, for a flush of pain came up inJames's face at the remembrance of what Fitzjocelyn had long agoforgotten--a passionate blow given to deter him from a piece ofwilful mischief, in which he was persisting for the mere amusement ofprovoking. It stood out among all other varieties of cuff, stroke,and knock, by the traces it had left, by Mrs. Frost's grief at it,and the forgiveness from the Earl, and it had been the mosthumiliating distress of James's childhood. It humbled him even now,and he answered--'You may be right, Louis; I may be not sufficiently altered since Iwas a boy. I have struck harder than I intended more than once, andI have told the boys so.''I am sure, if they had any generosity, they would have been touchedwith your amends,' cried Isabel.'After all, a schoolmaster's life does not tend to mend the temper,'concluded James, sighing, and passing his hand over his forehead.'No,' thought Louis, 'nor does Isabel's mutton!'CHAPTER XIII.THE CONWAY HOUSEHOLD. And ye shall walk in silk attire, And siller hae to spare, Gin ye'll consent to be his bride, Nor think of Donald mair. Miss BLAMIRE.What makes you so lame to-day?' asked Lord Ormersfield, as Louiscrossed the library, on returning from an interview to which he hadbeen summoned in another room.'I only stumbled over an obstruction on the Frost staircaseyesterday,' aaid Louis. 'Poor Jem chose to have me up to the nursery;and to see him in the paternal character is the funniest as well asthe pleasantest spectacle the house affords.''Ah! it is not what it was,' said the Earl. 'I suppose I must callthere before the holidays, though,' he added, reluctantly. 'But whatdid that man, Ramsbotham, want with you?''To ask our interest for that appointment for his friend Grant.''Indeed! what could bring him here?''Why, unluckily, he fancied he had some claim on me, on the score ofJem Frost's election. I was too innocent then to know what thosethings go for.''You may say so!' ejaculated the Earl. 'So he was insolent enough tobring that up, was he?''Worse,' said Fitzjocelyn; 'he wanted to threaten that, unless Iwould oblige him now, there were matters which it was his duty to laybefore the trustees. I told him he would do, of course, whatever washis duty; whereupon he thought my Lordship was interested in Mr.Frost.''Intolerably impertinent! I hope you set him down!''I told him that neither Mr. Frost nor I should wish him to pretermithis duty on any consideration whatever. Then he harked back to whathe did for us at the election; and I was forced to tell him that ifhe considered that he had thereby established a claim on me, I mustown myself in his debt; but as to reciprocating it, by putting in aperson like Grant, that was against my conscience. He flew into apassion, informed me that Mr. Frost would take the consequences,mounted the British Lion, and I bowed him out upon that majesticquadruped, talking grandly of illiberal prejudices and the risinggeneration.''You acknowledged that he had a claim on you?''As things go in this world, I suppose it is true.''Louis! you will never know how to deal with those people.''I am afraid not. I could not, either boldly or diplomatically, getrid of the charge; so there was nothing for it but to confess.That's not the worst of it. I am afraid he really will be able totake revenge on poor Jem, and I'm sure he can't afford to lose anymore scholars.''Such a fellow as that will not have much in his power againstJames,' said Lord Ormersfield. 'What I am afraid of is, that youhave cut the ground from under your feet. I cannot see how you areever to stand for Northwold.''Nor I,' said Louis. 'In fact, father, I have always thought it mostwonderfully kind forbearance that you never reproached me more for mydoings on that occasion. I believe we were all too happy,' hepresently added, with a sigh, which was re-echoed by his father, atthe same time trying to say something about youthfulness, to whichLouis, who had been leaning thoughtfully on the mantelpiece,presently answered--'How much wiser old people are than young! Anoriginal axiom, is not it? but it is the last which one learns!''You would hardly act in the same way now?' said his father.'I wonder when it ever answers to interfere with the natural courseof events!' responded Louis, musingly. 'There were two things thatMr. Calcott told me once upon a time.' Those two things he leftunuttered. They were--that the gentleman would be wasted on theschool, and that the lady was not made for a poor man's wife. Nowonder they made him sigh, but he concluded by exclaiming aloud--'Well, I hope they will both go to Estminster, and come back withfresh life!'The Estminster invitation was already on the road; but,unfortunately, Lady Conway had been unable to secure lodgings largeenough to receive the children. She was urgent, however, that Isabelshould come as soon as possible, since Louisa had been more unwellthan usual, and was pining for her eldest sister; and she hoped thatJames would join her there as soon as the holidays should set himfree.James was hurt to find Isabel so much delighted to go, but resolvedthat she should not be deprived of the pleasure, and petulantlydenied the offers, which became even entreaties, that she might waittill he could accompany her. He arranged, therefore, that he shouldfollow her in a fortnight's time, the Miss Faithfulls undertaking thecharge of their small namesakes; and Lady Conway wrote to fix a daywhen Delaford should come to take care of Isabel on her journey.James and Isabel laughed at this measure. Mrs. James Frost wascertainly not in circumstances to carry such a hero of the buttery inher suite; and Lady Conway herself had more sense than to haveproposed it, but for Delaford's own representations. In fact, therewas a pretty face at Dynevor Terrace, and he had been piqued enoughby the return of his letters to be resolved on re-establixhing hisinfluence. Therefore did he demonstrate to my Lady that the onlyappropriate trains would bring him to Northwold at seven in theevening, and take him and Mrs. James Frost Dynevor away at elevennext morning; and therefore did Isabel look up in a sudden fit ofrecollection, as the breakfast was being removed, and say,'Charlotte, Delaford is coming on Tuesday to fetch me to Estminster,and will sleep here that night.'Isabel little guessed that in the days when she viewed the fantasticViscount as her greatest enemy, the announcement of his approachwould have been far less appalling to her.'The wretch! the traitor! the vile deceiver!' thought Charlotte, notchary of her epithets, and almost ready to wreak her vengeance on thesilver spoons. 'He has gone and broken poor Marianne's heart, andnow he wants to treat me the same, and make me faithless to poor Tom,that is up in the mountain-tops and trusts to me! O me, what shall Ido? Mrs. Beckett is gone, and there's no one to give me an advice!If I speak to him or scorn him, he'll take his advantage all alike--and his words are so fine and so soft, that do what I will to hatehim when I'm away, he is sure to wind round me when he's there; and Ican't get away, and I'm a poor, lonely, fatherless and motherlessorphan, and a vain girl, that has listened already to his treacheroussuit more than poor Tom would think for.'Charlotte worked on in much grief and perplexity for some minutes,revolving the vanity that had led to her follies, and humblingherself in her own eyes. Suddenly, a flash of thought crossed her,and woke a smile upon her face, almost a look of mischief. She tiedon a clean apron, and running upstairs, opened the drawing-room door,and said, 'If you please, ma'am, might I ask Miss Faithfull's Marthato tea on Tuesday night?''Oh yes, if you like,' said Isabel, never raising her eyes from therebuilding of the ruined chapel in the valley.Away skipped Charlotte, and in two minutes was at the back door ofthe House Beautiful. Mrs. Martha had been grimly kind to her eversince she had been afflicted with the cook for a fellow-servant, andreceived her only with a reproof for coming gadding out, when sheought to be hard at work; but when she heard the invitation, shebecame wrathful--she had rather go ten miles out of her way than evenlook at 'that there Ford.'But Charlotte explained her purpose, and implored, and put her inmind that Mrs. Beckett was gone, and she had no protector; and Martharelented, told her that if she had minded her she would never havebeen in the scrape at all, but agreed, not without satisfaction, toafford Mr. Delaford the society of his old acquaintance.And so when Mr. Delaford, with his whiskers freshly curled and hisboots in a state of fascinating polish, walked up Dynevor Terrace,the door was opened by Ellen, and the red-faced cook and the uprightMrs. Martha sat on either side the fire. Daintily did he greet them,and stand warming himself before the fire, adapting his conversationto them for the next ten minutes, before he ventured to ask whetherMiss Arnold were still an inmate. 'Taking out dinner--taking intea,' gruffly replied Martha.Mr. Delaford waited, but Ellen only ran in for one moment to fetchthe kettle, and Martha discoursed as usual on the gold mines in Peru.By-and-by, when the parlour tea could by no possibility be supposedto be farther prolonged, there swept into the kitchen the statelynurse. Charlotte had run up to the nursery, and begged as a favourthat she might be left to watch the children, while Mrs. Nurseentertained Mr. Delaford below-stairs; and in pity to so grand agentleman, constrained to mix with such 'low servants,' the nurse hadyielded, and Charlotte sat safe and sound by the nursery fire,smiling at his discomfiture, and reading over Tom's letters with aneasier conscience than for many a day.Mr. Delaford was too much of a gentleman to be uncivil to the threedames by the kitchen fire, but he watched every step and everycreaking door. He even went the length of coming up to familyprayers, in hopes of there meeting Charlotte; but she only joined theprocession at the parlour door, and had flown upstairs, like a littlebird, before he was out again.The gentleman was affronted, and resolved to make her feel it. Theycould not but meet at the kitchen breakfast, and he barelyacknowledged her. This was the most trying stroke of all, for it sether, in the eyes of the cook and nurse, on a level with the inferiorservants, to whom he would not have deigned a look, and it was noteasy to resist showing that she was on more familiar terms with himthan all. But the instinct of self-protection and the wisdom ofsincerity came to her aid. She abstained from raising her eyes tohis face, from one conscious word or glance; she locked herself intoher pantry when she took down the breakfast-things, and avoided everyencounter, even when she had begun to feel that it would have beenmore flattering had he made more efforts. At last, dire necessityobliged her to accept his aid in carrying her mistress's box down thestairs. He walked backwards, she forwards. She would not meet hiseye, and he was too well-bred for one word on the stairs; but in thegarden he exclaimed, 'Miss Arnold, what have I done?''I never ought to have listened to you,' said Charlotte. 'It was notright by neither of us; so please say no more.''If you could understand--''I don't want to understand nothing.'Charlotte drove him on with the box till they were close to the fly,and then, leaving him and the man to adjust the packing, flew back toannounce that all was ready for her mistress. The last kisses weregiven to the children, and a message left with Charlotte for hermaster, who was in school; then she stood with Miss Catharine in herarms, and saw the fly drive off.'Well,' said Mrs. Cook, 'that butler thinks himself a great beau, nodoubt! I asked him whether he thought you pretty, Charlotte, and hesaid you hadn't no air nor no complexion. It's as I tells you--nobody will never take no notice of you while you goes about sodowdy.'Charlotte did not know whether she was glad that the cook could nottease her about Delaford, or mortified to be supposed beneath hisnotice. No air, forsooth! She who had often heard it said that shelooked like any lady!'But oh,' said Charlotte to herself, as she spent her daily fiveminutes at noonday in quiet thought, 'am I not a poor silly thing notto be thankful that care has been round me this time, and that I havenot been let to do nothing giddy nor false by Tom, whatever I mayhave thought!'Meanwhile, Isabel had found it much harder to part with her babiesfor three weeks than it had seemed at the first proposal; and therewere tears in her eyes as she gazed at the peaked, red-tiled roof ofthe old grammar-school, and reckoned the days and hours before herhusband would join her.Other associations revived when she found herself at Estminster, andwas received with shrieks of joy, caresses, and exclamations too fondand foolish to bear repetition; and then the pale Louisa restedagainst her, stroking her hand, and Lady Conway fondled her, andVirginia, looking formed and handsome, retreated a little way tostudy her and declare that she was the same Isabel, neither alterednor grown older--it was all a dream that she had ever left them.She almost felt it so herself, so entirely did she fit into the oldhabits, the little quiet dinner (only it seemed unusually good), thesubsequent closing round the fire with the addition of Miss King andLouisa, the easy desultory chat, the books with Mudie's stamp lyingabout, the music which must be practised. It was very like beingMiss Conway still; and when she awoke the next morning to find itlate, and to the impulse of hurrying up, or _not_ hurrying, expectingto find James making breakfast himself, and cross at being made latefor school, she turned on her pillow, half doubting whether she haddreamt these two years in one long night, and remembering thatcaptive mermaid, who had but to resume her maritime headgear andreturn to her native element, to forget the very existence of herfisherman husband and children. No! Isabel was not come to that! butshe was almost ashamed to enjoy her extra hour's repose; and then theleisurely breakfast--nay, even the hot rolls and clear coffee wereappreciated; and she sighed as she called up the image of thebreakfast over an hour ago, the grim kettle, the bad butter, theworse fire, and James, cold and hurried, with Kitty on his kneegnawing a lump of crust. It was a contrast to Lady Conway readingher letters and discussing engagements with comfortable complacency,and Virginia making suggestions, and Louisa's grave bright eyesconsulting hers, and Miss King quietly putting in a remark, and theanticipation of Walter's return, as if he were the only personwanting.The sisters always resented their mother's habit of talking of 'poorIsabel,' regarding her as the happiest of women; and they wereconfirmed in their belief by seeing her looking exceedingly well andhandsome, with perhaps a little more dignity and a sweeter smile.Virginia loved to snatch private interviews with Miss King, toexpress her confidence in dear Isabel's felicity, in theinfallibility and other perfections of James, and in the surpassingcleverness of little Catharine; and Louisa was always sighing tobehold the twins. But, to the delight of the school-room, the chapelin the valley was produced in a complete form, and a very prettyromance it was; but the hermit and the brilliant denouement werequite a shock to the young ladies, just when their tears wereprepared, and Virginia was almost angry.'Oh, my dear, there is trouble enough in the world!' said Isabel;'Hubert and Adeline have been my companions so long, that at least Imust leave them happy.''Indeed,' said Miss King, 'I am almost surprised that you have beenable to finish them at all, with so much re-writing.'To her surprise, Isabel blushed, and her answer partook of self-defence. 'James is so busy, and the children so young, that this hasbeen my great resource. When my little girls are older, I must begineducating in earnest. I want to talk over Madame Neckar's book withyou, Miss King.''All systems begin alike from infant obedience, I believe,' said thegoverness.'Yes,' said Isabel, 'little Catharine is obedience itself with us.It is curious to see how well she knows the difference between us andthe nurses. There are great tempests upstairs, and her papa takesthem very much to heart. He always has her downstairs when he is athome; and he has accustomed her to so much attention, that there isno doing anything while she is by, or I would have her more with me.'The self-justifying tone rather puzzled Miss King. She notedlikewise that Isabel was backward in entering into details of herhome life, and that she never said a word to encourage her sister'swishes to visit her at Northwold. Knowing Isabel as the governessdid, she was sure that she would not merely talk of things on thesurface, if her spirit were fully content. Only once did she go anydeeper, and that was as she took up a little book of religious poetryof which she had been very fond. 'Ah!' she said, 'I don't feel thesethings as I used. I think practical life dulls one.''I should have said, practical life made things real,' gaid MissKing.Isabel had not found out that having duties and not doing them wasless practical than having no particular task.Another cloud of mystery was over the relations with Mr. Dynevor andClara. Isabel baffled all Lady Conway's inquiries and advice byentering into no particulars, but adhering to her own version of thematter, 'that Mr. Dynevor had required of James conditionsincompatible with his duty,' and not deigning to explain either dutyor conditions, as beyond the capacity of her hearer.Of Clara no account was vouchsafed, except that Isabel believed shewas abroad; 'they had been very much disappointed in her,' and Isabelwas afraid that she was a good deal altered; and the snbject seemedso painful, that Virginia did not venture to push her inquiries anyfarther.The great subject of interest in the Conway family was that Virginiaand Louisa were going to lose their maid; and the suggestion somehowarose that Charlotte should be her successor. It was agreed on allhands that nature had formed her for a lady's-maid, and a few lessonsfrom a hairdresser would make her perfection; and she would beinvaluable in reading to Louisa when restless and unable to sleep.Isabel gave herself credit for the most notable arrangement she hadever made--promoting the little maiden, whom she really liked, andrelieving herself from the constant annoyance about sparing Ellenfrom the nursery by obtaining a stronger housemaid. She had only afew scruples, or rather she knew that James would have some, as toexposing Charlotte to Delaford's attentions after what she had heardin Clara's letter; but the least hint on this score led to apanegyric upon Delaford's perfections--his steadiness, his prudence,his cleverness on journeys, his usefulness in taking care of Walter.'I know that Walter is safe when he is with Delaford,' said LadyConway. And even the sensible Miss King observed, smiling, 'thatthere always _would_ be nonsense between men and maidservants; andthere were many more dangerous places than the present. She wouldwatch over Charlotte, and Fanshawe was quite to be trusted.'The Conway family knew rather less about their own servants' hallthan they did of feudal establishments five hundred years ago.Still, Isabel, in her superior prudence, resolved to consult Fanshaweon the true state of affairs. Fanshawe was a comfortable portlypersonage, chiefly absorbed in her caps and her good cheer, andfaring smoothly through life, on the principle of always saying whatwas expected of her, and never seeing anything to anybody'sdisadvantage.She assured Mrs. James Frost that she did not think Delaford toblame; many girls would be foolish about a man with personaladvantages, but she could not see it was his fault. Poor Mariannehad been always weakly, and, 'After all, ma'am, some young women willput constructions upon anything,' said Mrs. Fanshawe, deciding thatat least she should make no mischief by sacrificing poor Marianne.Isabel did not like to come to more individual inquiries, lest sheshould prepare discomfort for Charlotte; but she easily satisfiedherself that all was as right as convenient, and having occasion towrite some orders to Charlotte, communicated the proposal, sayingthat all should be settled on her return.There was wild work in the brain of the poor little Lady ofEschalott. No more stairs to scrub! No more mats to shake! No morehurrying after lost time, and an uneasy remembrance of undone duties!No more hardening of fingers, no more short-sleeved lilac, no morevulgarities from the cook! Ladylike dress, high wages, work amongflowers and gauzes, reading to Miss Louisa, housekeeper's-roomsociety, rank as 'Arnold' or 'Miss Arnold!' How much more suitableto the betrothed of the Superintendent at San Benito! To be sure,she was aware that a serpent lurked among the flowers; but she hadshown him a bit of her mind once, and she found she could take careof herself, and keep him at a distance.
