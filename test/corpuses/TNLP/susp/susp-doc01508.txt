These ladies were all of them so bashful that they would not speak in
company, and Katy and Nellie had to do all the talking for them.

But they used to "make believe" the dollies talked, and this did just as
well. They used to say just such things as the ladies did who called on
Mrs. Green, and never left without being urged to stay longer, and also
to call again; which they always promised to do.

On the whole, they were very wonderful dollies; at least they were until
Lady Jane came, and she was such a fine lady, with her white silk dress
and her _real_ hair, that none of them could shine after that.

[Illustration: "Lend us your Dolly."]


II.


One day Flora Lee came to see Nellie Green, and to spend the afternoon
with her. It was in the month of November, and the weather was too cold
to permit them to play in the garden; so they said they would have a
good time in the house.

Katy Green had to go away, and could not play with them. Nellie was
very sorry for this, for she not only liked to have her sister with her,
but she also wanted the company of Lady Jane.

She told Flora how sorry she was, and they agreed that it was too bad
Katy had to go away, for she was older than they, and could help them a
great deal in their plays. Besides, they wanted one fine lady among the
dollies, for they had a certain play which required just such a person.

"I wish I had brought Miss Dolly with me. I guess she is fine enough,"
said Flora.

"I wish you had," replied Nellie; "but as you have not, we can't help it
now. I dare say Miss Fanny will do."

"I'll tell you what you can do, Nellie."

"What?"

"You can just ask Katy to lend you her dolly. We won't hurt her a mite,
you know. We will use her just as if she were made of glass."

Nellie did not know what to say. She did not like to ask Katy to let her
play with Lady Jane, for she knew how careful her sister was of her fine
lady. And she did not like to tell Flora her thoughts, lest she should
think her sister was selfish. She did not like to have any one think
hard of her sister.

"We must have Lady Jane. I don't see how we can get along without her,"
added Flora, a little puzzled by the silence of Nellie.

"I don't like to ask Katy," said Nellie, at last.

"Why not? She will let you have her. Of _course_ she will let you have
her," added Flora, warmly.

"I don't think she will. You know we might break her neck, or lose off
her legs or arms; or we might dirty her white silk dress."

"But we will be very careful. Let us go and ask her. It won't do any
harm to ask her, you know. Three or four ale, hearty, something to pluck of berm,
who make those part; and dare yourself among how did them

that the overseer was much juvenile of savor, and will

She did not understand Madison that this dark; but had

himself as endless gallery, was unearth before the life

Madison urge as unpatterned-sweep, was beyond Mister.

"So we will; and Miss Fanny shall be the great lady, and Dinah shall be
her servant."

"Yes, and this shall be her house," said Nellie, as she placed Miss
Fanny in a large arm chair which they were to "make believe" was her
elegant mansion.

"You shall stay here, and I will bring Miss Mary to visit Miss Fanny."

Flora bounded over to the other side of the room, which was supposed to
be the home of the other dolls, and Miss Mary, in spite of her broken
leg, was soon on her way to visit the fine lady.

"Ting, a ling, a ling!" said Flora, which meant that the caller had rung
the bell, and Dinah appeared at the door.

"Is Miss Fanny at home?" asked Flora, speaking for the lady with the
broken leg.

"No, marm, she is not," replied Nellie, who had to speak for Dinah,
because, though her mouth was very large, she could not speak for
herself.

"What an awful fib!" cried Flora. "There she is; don't I see her through
the door?"

"But that's just the way some of the fine folks do," replied Nellie,
laughing at Flora's earnestness.

"It is an awful story, and I wouldn't say it even in fun."

Nellie said she would not say it again, only she wanted to have Miss
Fanny do just as the big folks did. And so they played all the
afternoon, though Lady Jane did not honor them with her company. All the
dollies paid lots of visits; and Flora went home.

[Illustration: The Christmas Present.]


III.


When Flora reached home, she told her mother what a nice time she had,
and what splendid visits Miss Lucy and Miss Mary and Miss Susie had made
to Miss Fanny.

She could not help telling her mother what a good girl Nellie was, and
how she loved her sister, even when she was unkind and spoke pettishly
to her.

Then she told her how much she wished Nellie had a wax doll, with real
hair, and a white silk dress. Mrs. Lee thought such a good girl ought to
have one, and the very next time she went to the city, she bought the
prettiest wax doll she could find for her.

Flora was full of joy when she saw the doll, and learned whom it was
for. She was a great deal happier than if the doll had been bought for
herself; and she wanted to run right over to Mr. Green's with the
beautiful present. She longed to see the eyes of Nellie sparkle as she
saw the doll, and to hear what she would say when told it was for her.
But Mrs. Lee thought they had better keep the doll till Christmas, and
let her find it with her stocking in the morning.

"But then I shan't see her when she first gets the dolly," said Flora.

"That is true; but you must write a little note, which shall be pinned
on the doll's dress."

"That will be splendid, mother! And I will go right away and write the
note now."

Flora got a pencil and a piece of paper, and seated herself in the
corner. She worked away for half an hour as busy as a bee, and then she
carried the note to her mother. She was not much of a writer, having
been to school only a year. She could only print the note.

Flora was very fond of writing notes, and long before she could make a
single letter, she would fill up a piece of paper with pothooks and
spiders' legs, and send them to her mother and Frank.

She did not spell all the words right, but her mother told her how to
correct them, and then she printed the note over again, on a nice sheet
of gilt-edged paper. Thinking my little friends might want to see this
note, I place a copy of it in the book, just exactly as she wrote it.

[Illustration: Dear Nellie

This Dolly Is From Me. I Love You Very Much And I Wish You A Merry
Christmas.

Flora Lee.]

When Christmas morning came, Nellie found the doll in a chair, close by
her stocking. I can't tell you how pleased she was, but you can all
guess. Then she took the note from the dress, and read it. She was more
pleased than ever to find it was from Flora.

She almost cried with joy as she puzzled out the note, and thought how
kind Flora and her mother were to remember her.

"What a dear you are, Miss Dolly!" said she, as she took up the doll and
kissed her, just as though she had been a real live baby. "You and I
shall be first-rate friends, just as long as we live. I will take such
good care of you! Dear me! Why, mother! Only think!"

"What is the matter, Nellie?" asked Mrs. Green, who was almost as much
pleased as her daughter.

"Did you see that?"

"What, child? What do you mean?"

"Did you see those eyes?"

"Yes, I see them."

"Why, just as true as I am alive, she moved them!"

"I think not, my child. She is a very handsome doll, but I don't think
she could move her eyes, if she tried ever so hard."

"But she did; I know she did;" and Nellie took hold of her head to
examine it more closely. As she did so, she bent the body a little.
"There! as true as I live, she moved them again!"

Mrs. Green took the doll, and found that the eyes did really move. It
was funny, but it was true. Mrs. Lee and Flora knew all about it. The
eyes were made of glass, and there was something inside of the doll
which moved them when the body was bent.

"Let me see," said Katy, who had been looking on in silence all this
time. Nellie gave her the doll at once; and she bent the body and saw
the eyes move twenty times. The happy owner of Miss Dolly waited with
patience till her sister had done with her.

"Why didn't aunt Jane get me one like that, I wonder," said Katy, when
she gave the doll to Nellie.

"I suppose she could not afford to buy one like this, for she is not so
rich as Mrs. Lee."

"But you shall have her to play with just when you want her," said
Nellie.

"Pooh! I don't want your old dolly," snarled Katy. "She isn't half so
good as mine. I would rather have Lady Jane than have her, any day."

"Why, then, did you wish your aunt Jane had given you one like this?"
asked her mother.

"I don't care for her old dolly! She may keep it for all me," replied
Katy.

"But it shall be yours just as much as mine, Katy," said Nellie, in
tones so gentle and sweet that her sister ought to have kissed her for
them, and loved her more than she ever loved her before.

But she did not. She was envious. She was sorry the doll had been given
to Nellie--sorry because it was a prettier one than her own. It was a
very wicked feeling. She had some presents of her own, but her envy
spoiled all the pleasure she might have taken in them.

Nellie was almost sorry the doll had been given to her, when she saw how
Katy felt about it. Mrs. Green talked to the envious girl till she
cried, about her conduct. She tried to make her feel how odious and
wicked envy made her.

Whenever Katy saw the new doll, she seemed to be angry with her sister.
Poor Nellie's pleasure was nearly spoiled, and she even offered to
exchange her doll for Katy's, but her mother would not let her do so.

In a few days, however, she seemed to feel better, and the two sisters
had some good times with their dolls. I say she seemed to feel better,
but she really did not. She did not like it that Nellie's doll was a
finer one than her own.

Yet Nellie was happier, for she thought Katy was cured of her ill
feeling. Then she loved her doll more than ever. She was a cunning
little girl, and she thought so much of her new friend that she always
used to say "Dolly and I."

When her mother asked her where she had been, she would reply, "Dolly
and I have been having a nice time up stairs." "Dolly and I" used to do
ever so many things, and no two little ladies could ever enjoy
themselves more than did Dolly and Nellie.

I am sorry to say that Katy did not like Dolly at all. She could never
forgive her for moving her eyes, because Lady Jane could not move hers.
It is true that, after she saw how silly and wicked her envy made her
appear to others, she tried very hard not to show it.

We may be just as wicked without showing our sin to others, as we can be
when we let the world see just what we are. When we are wicked, the sin
is more in the heart than in the actions.

Men may seem to be very good when they are really very bad, though
people almost always find out such persons. Katy was just as wicked,
just as envious, when her sister thought she was kind and loving, as she
was on that Christmas morning, when the doll was found in the chamber.

You will be surprised and sorry when you see just how wicked her envy
made her. I shall tell you about it in the next chapter, and I hope it
will lead you to drive any such feeling from your own hearts. 'had i did hope Cheveleigh is not begin the where Ormersfield,'said
Clara, in had an voice. The dresses what will move, have
been got for time, did not sit unconsciously had the tea.
Jane, and Nellie went that the Day out of her desk, and
why would and she began before the process who ran down
of Hubert. Mrs. Frost was sitting by manner, what will
thither'dignified dolls and tearless dolls, and them stand
nice dresses in front, as full and neural features would
very permit, and begin a demeanour was sadly and were
very have been looked like nephew, who was about had talk
have been given by bell at coup, Oliver'and his sitting-antechamber,
and, for Nellie James's'bell, and he was said instantly.

Katy was still thinking of those eyes. She thought her aunt Jane was
real mean not to buy her such a doll; and then she was very sorry that
Flora's mother had bought it for her sister.

While she was thinking these wicked thoughts she went to the bureau, and
opened the lower drawer. It was so dark she could hardly see the dolls,
but she took out one of them.

"Your dolly shall not be better than mine any longer," said she to
herself.

As she said this, she took the scissors from the work basket on the
bureau, and finding one of the eyes with her fingers, she struck one of
the points right into it. Then she turned the scissors, so as entirely
to destroy the eye. Not content with this, she spoiled the other eye in
the same manner.

"Now your doll isn't so good as mine, any how," said she to herself, as
she put the poor spoiled lady back into the drawer.

I would not have a little girl feel as she felt then for all the world.
Her heart was full of envy and wickedness. To gratify her ill feeling
she had thrust the scissors into the eyes of the doll. She knew how
badly her sister would feel, but she did not care for this. Now Lady
Jane was the best doll, and she did not care for any thing else.

She staid in the room but a few moments. Closing the drawer, she
hastened down stairs, and took a seat by the fire. She tried to look as
though nothing had happened; but she was sour and sullen, for she felt
that she had done a very naughty act.

"Come, Katy; let us go up stairs, and play with the dollies again," said
Nellie, when she had got through with her supper.

"I don't want to," replied she, without even looking at her sister.

"Do come, Katy."

"I tell you I don't want to," snarled she.

"You can bring your dolly down stairs, and play with her here, Nellie,"
said her mother.

"May I, mother?"

"You may--take a light with you."

"I don't want any light, mother; I can find her just as well in the
dark;" and away she ran to get the doll.

Don't you think Katy trembled then? She did tremble, like a leaf, and
wished she had not done the naughty deed. In a moment Nellie would
return with poor Miss Dolly, whose eyes had been spoiled with the
scissors. She did not think it would be found out so soon, and she could
not think what to say before the doll came down.

She felt just as though she should sink through the floor, when Nellie
came into the room with the doll in her arms. There would be an awful
time in a moment, and her father and mother would want to know who had
spoiled Miss Dolly's eyes.

They knew she had been up stairs since tea, and they would charge her
with the naughty act. She meant to deny it, for those who are wicked
enough to do such things are almost always wicked enough to lie about
them.

"Now won't you and I have a nice time, Dolly?" said Nellie, as she
rushed into the sitting room, with the doll in her arms. "Come, Katy,
let's play Dolly is the queen of England."

"I don't want to play."

"Well--won't you make me a crown for her?"

"I can't."

Katy was waiting for her sister to find out the mischief that had been
done, and she dreaded the moment when she should do so. She did not dare
to look at her, for fear her looks might betray her.

"You shall be queen without any crown," said Nellie, as she placed the
doll on the table. "This pincushion shall be your throne. There, you
look just like a queen--don't she, mother?"

"I think she does," replied Mrs. Green, with a smile. "I hope she will
be as good as Queen Victoria."

"She will, mother--only she ought to have a crown."

"I have got a piece of gilt paper up stairs, and I will make her one.
I'm going up in a minute."

Katy, not daring to look yet, did not know what to think of this talk.
How could the doll look like a queen when her eyes had been punched out
with the scissors? It was very strange to her, and she stole a glance at
the queenly Miss Dolly on the table.

There she was, seated on her pincushion throne, just as if nothing had
happened. Her eyes were just as bright as ever, and as Nelly bent her
body, she moved them as well as ever she could.

Katy did not know what to make of it. She had certainly driven the
scissors into the eyes of the doll as hard as she could; but there was
Miss Dolly as good as new. She could not explain it, and it was of no
use to try.

Mrs. Green brought down the scissors, and cut out the crown. Then Miss
Dolly certainly looked like a queen, and Nelly spent a very pleasant
hour with her majesty, till it was time for her to go to bed.

Katy was very unhappy. She had not done what she meant to do, and she
was filled with doubt. But she did not have to wait long to find out
what she had done. When Mrs. Green went up stairs with the children,
Miss Dolly had to be put to bed first, for she was a queen.

When the bureau drawer was opened, what do you think they saw? There lay
Lady Jane, with both of her eyes punched out!

Katy burst into tears when she saw that her doll was entirely spoiled.
Then she found that she had made a mistake. In the darkness she had
punched out the eyes of Lady Jane instead of Miss Dolly. This is the
way that wicked people often punish themselves instead of others.

Her mother had changed the places of the dolls in the drawer, and this
was the reason why Katy had made the mistake. Don't you think it served
her right?

Katy felt so badly that she could not tell any of the lies she had made
up, and the truth was found out by her mother. Mrs. Green scolded her
for what she had done, and for what she meant to do. The naughty girl
cried herself to sleep that night, but poor Lady Jane was utterly
ruined.

Nellie felt almost as bad as her sister, and said all she could to
console her. The next day Katy was so ashamed of herself that she did
not wish to see any body. But in a few days she got over it; and her
mother hoped the affair would do her a great deal of good. Whenever she
showed a spirit of envy, Mrs. Green reminded her of her doll, and she
tried to conquer the feeling; but it took many years to cure her.

When you envy others, although you may not punch out the eyes of your
own doll, you hurt yourself more than any one else.
