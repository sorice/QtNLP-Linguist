To the right of him was a narrow window . Through that window a dizzy depthbelow lay the city . Its square flat roofs formed a mammoth checker_board . Between the squarescriss_crossed the narrow black streets . Like a white chalk_line drawn by a careless child the river wound its crooked way across this checker_board_To the left of him was a second narrow window . Through this he caught the dark gleam of thebroad waters of Lake Michigan . Here and there across the surface twinkled the lamps of a vessel or flashed the warning beacon of a lighthouse_A boy in his late teens was Curlie . Slender dark with coal_black eyes with curls of thesame hue clinging tightly to his well_shaped head he had the strong profile and the smoothtapering fingers that might belong to an artist a pickpocket or a detective_An artist Curlie was an artist in his line _radio . Although still a boy he was already anoperator of the commercial extra first_class type . So far as license and title were concerned he could go no higher . A pickpocket he was not but a detective he might be thought to be a strange type of detective however a detective of the air the kind that sits in a smallroom hundreds of feet in air and listens listens to the schemes the plots the counterplotsof men and to the wild babble of fools . His task was that of aiding in the capture of knavesand the silencing of foolish folks who used the newly_discovered radiophone as their mouthpiece . Foolish people Major Whittaker Curlie s superior who had called him to the service hadsaid do quite as much damage to the radio service as crooks . Fools and knaves must alikebe punished and your task will be to help catch them . Wonderful ears had Curlie Carson perhaps the most wonderful ears in the world . In catchingthe fine shadings of diminishing sounds which came to him through the radio compass therewas not a man who could excel him_So Curlie sat there surrounded by wire_wrapped frames coils keys buttons switches motors dry_cells storage batteries and all the odds and ends which made up the equipment of the mostperfect listening_in station in the world_As he sat there with Joe Marion his pal by his side his brow was wrinkled in thought . Hewas reviewing the events of the previous night . At 1 00 a_m the witching hour when the crookedones the mean ones come creeping forth like ghosts to carry on doubtful conversations byradio a strange thing had happened . A message had gone crashing out through space . Wave lengths1200 meters long sped it on its way . There was power enough behind it to carry it from poleto pole but all it had said was . A slight breeze from the west . Three times the message had been repeated then had come silence . There had been no answerthough Curlie had listened long for it on 1200 meter wave lengths and five other lengths as well_Sudden as had come the message fleet as had been its passing it had not been too fleet forCurlie . He had compassed its direction measured its distance . On a map of the city which laybefore him he had made a pencil cross and said . It came from there . And he was right for strange as it may seem an expert such as Curliecan sit in a hidden tower room such as his was and detect the exact location of a station whosemessage has set his ear drums aquiver_The location had puzzled him . There was not a station in the city licensed to send 1200 meterwave lengths . The spot he had marked was the location of the city s most magnificent apartmenthotel . The hotel possessed a radiophone set . Its antennae hung high upon the building s roof were capable of carrying that 1200 meter message with all that power behind it but the radioequipment of the hotel had no such power . Something crooked about that he had mumbled to himself_His first impulse had been to call the police . He did not act upon it . They might blunder_The thing might get out . This law_breaker might escape . Not five people in all the world knewof Curlie s detecting station . He would work out this problem alone_Now as he sat thinking of it he decided to confide this new secret to his pal Joe Marion . Yes he told himself I ll tell him about it at chow . At this moment his mind was recalled to other matters . New trouble was brewing . A slight breeze from the west his mind went over the message automatically and the windwas due east . Don t mean much as it stands but I suspect means a lot more than it seems to . Just above Curlie s head there hung a receiver . To the right and left of him were two loud_speakers_Before him ranged three others . Each one of these was tuned to a certain wave length 200 350 500 600 1200 meters . Each was modulated down until sounds came to Curlie s delicatelytuned ear drums as little more than whispers . A concert was being broadcast on 350 . The boomingtones of a baritone had been coming in as softly and sweetly as a mother s lullaby . But nowCurlie s ear detected interference_Instantly he was all alert . The receiver was clamped down over his ears a half dozen switcheswere sent snap snap snap . There followed a dead silence . Then in a shrill boyish voice together with the baritone s renewal of his song there came . I want the world to know that I am a wireless operator op_er_a_a_tor . Hoop_la . Tra_la . Curlie smiled in spite of his vexation . He acted quickly and with precision . His slender fingersguided a coil_wound frame from right to left . Backward and forward it glided and as it movedthe boyish Hoop_la rose and fell . Almost instantly it came to a standstill . There . That s it _ he breathed_Then to Joe Marion It s a shame about those kids . They won t learn to play the game square_Don t know the rules and don t care . Think we can t catch em I guess . His hand went out for a telephone . Superior 2231 he purred . That you 2231 . Just a moment . He touched a key here another there . He twisted a knob there then . That you Mulligan _ he half whispered . Good . There s a kid on your beat got a wireless running wild . Yes . Brokein on the concert . Don t be hard on him . No license . Yes guess that s right . Take away hissending set . Give him another chance . Let him listen in . What s that . Location . Clarendon Street near Orton Place about second door I d say . That s all right . Thanks yourself . Dropping the receiver on its hook he tossed off his headpiece snapped at five buttons thensettled back in his chair . These kids ll be the death of me yet he grumbled . Always breaking in not meaning any harmbut doing harm all the same . I don t feel so very sore about them though . It s the fellowsthat go in for long wave lengths and high power that break in on 500 1200 and 1800 thatdo the real damage . Had a queer case last night . Looks crooked too . He was silent for a momentthen he said reflectively . Guess that s about all till midnight . It s after midnight that the queer birds come creepingout . I m going to tell you about that one last night over the ham sandwich dill pickle andcoffee . No use to try now _we d sure get broken in on . Joe Marion who had been taken on as an understudy by Curlie was at the present time workingwithout pay . At times when trouble developed on two different wave lengths at once he tooka hand and helped out . For the most part he merely looked listened and learned_His pal he held in the greatest admiration . And who would not . Had he not when this greatbig new thing the radiophone came leaping right into the world from nowhere been able totake a hand from the very beginning and become at once a valuable servant of his beloved country . Had he not at times detected meddlers who were endangering the lives of men upon the high seas . Had he not at one time received the highest of commendations from the great chief of this secretservice of the air . To Joe there was something weirdly fascinating about the whole business . Here they were twoboys in the tower of the highest building in a great city . Five people knew of their presence_These five were high up in the radio secret service . No message sent out by them could everbe traced back to its source . They did not use the air . That would be dangerous easily traced_They did not use the telephone alone . That too would be dangerous . But when a radiophonehad been connected to the telephone wire and tuned to a certain wave length then they talkedand not even the person they talked with would ever know whence came the message . This wasa necessary precaution for from this very tower dangerous bands of criminals gangs of smugglers and all other types of law_breakers would ultimately be brought to justice . And if these butknew of the presence of this boy in his tower room some dark night that tower would be rockedby an exploding bomb and the boy in his room would be shaken to earth like a young mud_waspin his nest . I ll tell you said Curlie as he rose to answer a tap on the door I believe that affairlast night was some big thing but what it was I can t even guess . He opened the door to let in Coles Masters his relief then motioning to Joe he took his capand left the room . Down the winding stairs which led to the elevator several stories lowerdown they made their way in silence at last to enter a cage and be silently dropped to theground hundreds of feet below_CHAPTER IISOMETHING BIG You see Curlie began as he crossed his slim legs beside a small table in an all_night lunchroom buried somewhere in the deep recesses of this same skyscraper that fellow sent themessage about the easterly breeze that blew west and I located the station at that hotel . Thismorning I went over to see how the place looked . It s a wonderful hotel that one palm gardenin the middle of it marble columns fountain painted sheet iron ceiling that d make you dizzyto look at and the finest dressed people you ever saw walking around everywhere . Well I found my way to the sending room of the radiophone and right away the operator wantedto throw me out said I was a fresh kid and all that . But when I showed him my papers he calmeddown a lot and showed me everything he had . I saw right away it wasn t his equipment that had sent that message _that d be like sendinga Big Bertha bomb into Paris with a twenty_two caliber rifle . He just naturally didn t havethe power that s all . So I didn t tell him anything about it just walked out and went aroundback to where I could see the way his wires ran from the sending room to the antenna . I hadn t any more than got there and had one look_up when along strolls a man who wants toknow what I m looking at . I saw right away that he wasn t a hotel employee for he didn t weareither a bandmaster s uniform nor a cutaway coat so I just smiled and said . Got a girl friend up there on the sixteenth floor . She s leaving this morning and arrangedto drop her trunk down to me so s not to have to tip the porter . Well sir I hadn t more than said that than a girl did pop her head out of a sixteenth floorwindow and stare straight down at me . The fellow actually dodged . Guess he thought the trunk was due any minute . Funny part of it was the girl actually seemed interested in me just as if she had met mesomewhere before . Of course she was too high up for me to tell what she was like but it mademe mighty curious . I counted the windows to right and left so I could find that room if I wantedto . The window was only the third to the right from where the lead wire to the antenna went up . Well then that fellow Mr . Carson _ a voice interrupted Curlie . Anyone here by the name of Carson . It came fromthe desk_clerk of the eating place . That s me exclaimed Curlie jumping up . Telephone . All right . Be back in a minute Joe . Curlie was away to answer the call . Lo . That you Curlie _ came through the receiver . This is Coles Masters . Got a bad case _extrabad . Can t understand it . Fellow s sending 600 meter waves with enough power to cross theAtlantic . Six hundred _ exclaimed Curlie in a tense whisper . Why that s what they use for S_O_S_ atsea . It s criminal . Endangers every ship in distress . Five years in prison for it . Get him can t you . Can t . That s the trouble . Every time I think I ve got him spotted he seems to move . To move . Yes sir . That s queer . I ll be up right away . Come on exclaimed Curlie grabbing his hat and dragging Joe to his feet . It s a big one_Moves he says . Sends 600 big power . Bet it s that same hotel fellow . Gee whiz . Supposingit turned out to be that sixteenth story girl and she caught me spying on her . I tell you it ssomething big . Impatient at the slowness of the up_shooting elevator Curlie at last leaped out before theiron door at the top was half open then two steps at a time sprang up a flight of stairs_Out of breath he arrived at the final landing sprang through the door to the secret towerroom then seizing his headpiece sank into a chair_By a single move of the hand Coles Masters indicated the radio_compass he had been listeningin on . That s where he was last time he spoke he grumbled but no telling where he ll be next_He s been dodging all over that stretch of country . Curlie s fingers moved rapidly . He adjusted the coil of a radio_compass here another thereand still another here . He twisted the knob of each to the 600 mark then twisting the tuningknobs lined them all up to receive on the same wave length . The winding of each was set ata slightly different angle from any other . That about covers him he mumbled . Get the distance . Near as I could make out said Coles Masters it was from ten to fifteen miles . He movestoward us then away at times just as he does to right and left . Hm sighed Curlie resting his chin on his hands . That s a new dodge this moving business_Complicates things that does . For a time he sat in a brown study . At last he spoke again this time quite as much to himselfas to the other . Folks don t move unless they have a way to move . That fellow has some means of locomotion_Anyway he sighed it s not our friend of the big hotel unless _unless he or she or whoeverit is has taken to locomotion and that s not likely . Not the same side of the city . Out nearthe forest preserve . Yes or a little beyond said Coles . What do you think asked Curlie suddenly has he got an automobile or an airplane . Can t tell said Coles thoughtfully . You can t really judge distances in air accurately_There are powerful equipments which might be mounted on either automobiles or airplanes . The thing that puzzled me though was his line of chatter . All about some map old French and a lot of stuff like that . I Suddenly he broke off . A grinding sound had come from one of the loud speakers . There followedin a clear strong voice . Map O_K . Old French is amazing . Good for a million . Curlie s fingers were busy once more as a tense look drew his forehead into a scowl . About fifteen miles he whispered_Then the voice resumed . Time up the bird . When . A tense silence ensued . Then faint as if from far away yet very distinctly there came thesingle word . Wednesday . This was followed by three letters distinctly pronounced . L_C_W . A second later came the strong voice in answer . A_C_S . That said Curlie as he settled back in his chair in my estimation ends the night s entertainment_But the nerve of the fellow _ he exploded . Sending that kind of rot on six hundred . Why atthis very moment some disabled ship might be struggling in a storm on the Great Lakes or evenon the Atlantic and this jumble of words would muddle up their message so its meaning wouldbe lost and the ship with it . The worst I could wish for such a fellow is that he be droppedinto the sea with some means of keeping afloat but with neither food nor drink and a ship nowherein sight . If Curlie had known how exactly this wish was to be granted in the days that were to come he might have experienced some strange sensations_He straightened up and placed a dot on the map before him . That s where he was . I ll motor out in the morning and have a look at things . May discoversome clew . Curlie was a bright American boy of the very best type . Like most American boys who do nothave riches thrust upon them when he wanted a thing he made it or made a way to get it . Threeyears previous he had wanted an automobile _wanted it awfully . And his total capital had been 49_63 . He had been wanting that car for some time when an express train hit a powerful roadsteron a crossing near his home_Having flocked in with the throng to view the twisted remains of the car he had been struckwith an idea . This idea he had put into action . The railroad had settled with the owner forthe car . They had the wreck of it on their hands . Curlie bought it for twenty_five dollars_To his great delight he had found the powerful motor practically uninjured . The driving geartoo with the exception of one cog wheel was in workable order . The remainder of the car hesold to a junk dealer for five dollars . It was twisted and broken beyond redemption_He had next searched about for a discarded chassis on which to mount his gears and motor . Thissearch rewarded he had proceeded to assemble his car . And one fine day he sailed out uponthe street with the Humming Bird as he had named her . Better call her Gravel Car Joe had said when he saw that she had no body at all and thathe must ride with his feet thrust straight out before him in a homemade seat bolted to a buckboard_likeplatform_But when on a level stretch of road Curlie had let her out Joe had at once acquired animmense respect for the Humming Bird . For he said later she can hum and she can go likea streak of light and that s about all any humming bird can do . No further messages of importance having drifted in to him from the outer air Curlie an hourbefore dinner made his way down to the street and having warmed up the Humming Bird s motor muttered as he sprang into the seat . I ll just run out there and see what I see . A half hour later just as the first gray streak of dawn was appearing he curved off ontoa gravel road . Here he threw his car over to one side and switching on a flashlight steeredwith one hand while he bent over the side to examine the left_hand track_There had been a light rain at ten that night . Since that time a heavy car with diamond_treadtires had passed along the road leaving its tracks in certain soft sandy spots . Maybe that s him Curlie murmured_A little farther on stopping his machine he got out and walked along the road . Examiningthe surface closely he walked on for five rods then wheeled about and made his way back tothe car . He was over this road three times last night . That looks like a warm scent . Can t tell though_My friend might not have been in a car at all might have been in a plane . We ll have a look at the very spot . He twirled the wheel and was away_A half mile farther down the road he paused to look at a map . Not quite here he murmured . About a quarter mile farther . The car crept over another quarter of a mile . When he again came to a halt he found himselfon a stretch of paved road . This is the spot from which the last message was sent . Tough luck _ he muttered . Can t tell a thing here . Glancing to his right he sat up with a start . He had suddenly become aware of the fact thathe was just before the gate of the estate of J . Anson Ardmore reputed to be the richest manof the city . Huh . Curlie grunted . Car must have stood about here when that last message was sent . Maybeit went up that lane . Maybe it didn t too . J . Anson s got a son about my age I guess . Vincentthey call him . He might be up to something . There s a girl too sixteen or so . Can t tellwhat these rich folks will do . He stepped down the rich man s private drive but here the surface of crushed stone was soperfectly kept that no telltale mark was to be seen_He did not venture far as he had no relish for being caught trespassing on such an estatewithout some good explanation for his conduct . Just at that moment he had no desire to explain_As he turned to go back he caught the thud_thud of hoof beats along the private drive_Fortunately the abundant shrubbery hid him from view . Hardly had he reached the machine andassumed the attitude of one hunting trouble in his engine when a girl rounded a corner at fullgallop_Dressed in full riding costume and mounted on a blooded horse she swung along as gracefulas a lark . As she came into the public highway she flashed Curlie a look and a smile . Thenshe was gone_Curlie liked the smile even if it did come from one of the four hundred . Gee . Old Humming Bird he exclaimed as he patted his car did she mean that smile for youor for me . So there might be a girl in the case same as there seems to be in that one overat the hotel . Girl in most every case . What if she sent those messages and I found her out . That would sure be tough . But business is business . He set his mouth grimly . You can t fool with old Uncle Sam notwhen you re endangering the lives of some of his bravest sons at sea . He threw in the clutch and drove slowly along the road . Twice he paused to examine the tracksmade the night before . Each time he discovered marks of the diamond tread . That radiophone was mounted on a car he decided I ll stake my life on that . Now if hekeeps it up how am I to catch him . CHAPTER IIIA WHISPER IN THE NIGHTThe next night found Curlie in the secret tower room alone . Joe Marion was away helping torun down a case of malicious interference . It was curious business this work of the radio secret service . Though he had been at it formonths Curlie had never quite got used to it . A detective he was in the truest sense of theword yet how different from the kind one reads about in books_He laughed as he thought of it now . Then as his tapering fingers adjusted a screw his browbecame suddenly wrinkled in thought . He was troubled by the two cases which had lately developed the one at the hotel and that other the station that moved . How was he to locate that powerfulsecret station in the hotel . How was he to discover the owner of that mysterious moving radio . He could not answer these questions . And yet somehow they must be answered . He knew that_The operator in the hotel was sending on 1200 meter wave lengths . State messages were constantlybeing sent across the Atlantic on 1200 messages of the greatest importance . There was a conferenceof nations at that moment going on in Europe . America s representative must be kept in constanttouch with the government officials at Washington . If this person at the hotel persisted insending messages on 1200 meter wave lengths an important message might at any moment be blurredor lost_Not less important was the breaking in of this moving operator on 600 . This was the wave lengthused by ships and by harbor stations . Great steamships sometimes waited for hours to get amessage ashore on 600 . If this person were to be allowed to break in upon them they might waithours longer . Thousands of dollars would be lost . And then as we have said before the messageof some ship in distress might be lost because of this person s interference . When oh when sighed Curlie will people become used to this new thing the radiophone . When will they learn that it is a great new servant of mankind and not a toy . When will theytake time to instruct themselves regarding the rights of others . When will they develop a consciencewhich will compel them to consider those rights . The answer which came to his mind was Perhaps never . But little by little they will learnsome things . It is my duty not alone to detect but to teach . He shifted uneasily in his chair then held his ear close to the loud speaker tuned to 200_A message came floating in to him across the air a mysterious whispered message . Hello Curlie it said . You don t know me but you have seen me Automatically Curlie s fingers moved the radio_compass backward and forward while his mindgauged the distance . His right hand scrawled some figures on a pad and all the time his earswere strained to catch the whisper . I have seen you it went on and I like your looks . That s why I m talking now . For a second the whisper ceased . There was something awe_inspiring about that whisper . As hesat in his secret chamber away up there against the sky Curlie felt as if some spirit_beingwas floating about out there in the sky on a fleecy cloud and pausing now and then to whisperto him . I saw you the whisper repeated . You are in very grave danger . He is a bold and treacherousman . It s big Curlie _big_ . The whisper rose shrilly . But you must be careful . You mustnot let him know the place where you listen in . I don t know where it is . But I do know youlisten in . Be careful _careful _careful c_a_r_e_f_u_l The whisper trailed off into space to be lost in thin air_Wiping the beads of perspiration from his face Curlie sat up . Well now he whispered softlyto himself what do you know about that . One thing I do know he told himself . I d swear it was a girl s whisper though how youcan tell a girl s whisper is more than I know . Question is . Which one is it _hotel stationor the one that moves . For a moment his brow wrinkled in thought . Then with an exclamation of disgust he exclaimed . That s easy . I ve got their location . He figured for a few seconds then put a pencil point on a certain spot on his map . There _ he muttered . It s the hotel the exact spot . Suddenly he started . There came the rattle of a key in the door . Oh _ he exclaimed as Coles Masters shoved the door open it s you . I m glad you re here_Got something I want to look into . Want to bad . Mind if I take an extra hour . Nope . All right . See you later . With a bound he was out of the door and down the stairs . That boy muttered Coles Masters with a grin will either die young or become famous . OnlyProvidence knows which it will be . Curlie did not leave the elevator at the first floor . Dropping down to the sub_basement hewound his way in and out through a labyrinth of dimly lighted halls at last to climb a stairto the first basement . Then having passed into his accustomed eating place he paused longenough to purchase a Swiss cheese sandwich after which with cap pulled well down over hiseyes he made his way up a second flight of stairs into the outer air_He shivered as he emerged into the open street . Whether this chill came from the damp coolof the night or from nervous excitement he could not tell . The memory of the whispered warningbore heavily upon his mind_Turning his face resolutely in the direction of the hotel he walked three blocks then haileda passing taxi . When the taxi dropped him a few minutes later he was still four blocks fromthe point of his destination . Covering this distance with rapid strides he came to the rearof the hotel . There dodging past a line of waiting taxis he came at length to a dark cornerwhere a stone bench made an angle with the wall of a building directly behind the hotel_Crouching in this corner he glanced rapidly from right to left to learn whether or not hisarrival had been detected . Satisfied that for the moment he was safe he cast a glance upwardto where the aerials of the radiophone glistened in the moonlight . From that point he allowedhis gaze to drop steadily downward until it reached the windows of the sixteenth floor . Thereit remained fixed for a full moment_There came from between his teeth a sudden intake of breath_Had he seen some movement at the window to the right of the wires that led to the aerials . He must see no matter how great the risk_Drawing a small pair of binoculars from his pocket he fixed them on the spot . He then turneda screw at the side of the binocular and suddenly there appeared upon the wall of the buildinga round spot of brilliant light . The size of a plate this mysterious spot moved rapidly backwardand forward until it at last rested upon the wires by the window . Ah _ came in an involuntary whisper from the boy s lips_A hand the slender graceful hand of a girl had been clearly outlined against the wall . Quicklyas it had been withdrawn Curlie had seen that between the thumb and finger of that hand wasthe end of a wire . Been tapping the aerial . A girl _ he muttered incredulously . And it was she who whisperedto me out of the night . He had been crouching low . Now he rose stretched himself pocketed his instrument and wasabout to make his way out of the yard when with the suddenness of a tiger a body launcheditself upon his back_So unexpected was the assault that the boy s body closed up like a jack knife . He fell facedown completely doubled up with his face between his knees . Now I got yuh _ was snarled into his ear . The weight on his back was crushing . He could scarcelybreathe . You _you have he managed to groan . You ll come along said the voice_Curlie did not speak nor stir . The weight was partly lifted from his back . The man had droppedone foot to the ground_Now Curlie had he been properly exercised for it when he was a child might have turned outa fair contortionist . He was exceedingly slim and limber and had learned many of the tricksof the contortionist . He had done this merely to amuse his friends . Now the tricks stood himin good stead_He did not attempt to rise by straightening up as most persons would have done . When the pressuregrew less he lay still doubled up face down upon the ground_This gave him two advantages . It led his assailant to believe him injured in some way and atthe same time left him in position for the next move_When the pressure had been sufficiently removed for his purpose he took a quick strong breath then with a rush which set every muscle in action he thrust his head between his knees grippedhis own ankles and did a double turn over which resembled nothing so much as a boulder rollingdown hill_The next instant finding himself free he sprang to his feet dodged behind a taxi shot pastthree moving cars leaped to the pavement skirted a wall then dodged into an alley_Down this alley there was a doorway . Into the shadow of this doorway he threw himself . Therewas a hole in the wooden door . A hook could be reached through the hole . The hook quickly lifted he found himself inside a narrow court at the back of a large apartment building . There wasa driveway from this court into the street beyond_Assuming a natural pace he made his way down this driveway and out into the street where with a low whistled tune he made his way back toward the heart of the city . Five blocks fartherdown he paused to adjust his clothing . Wow _ but that was a close one he muttered . Don t know who my heavy friend was but he surewanted to detain me for some reason or other . But say _ he mused how about that girl . HopeI didn t get her in bad by flashing that light on her hand . But then he thought more soberly perhaps she is the principal bad one . Perhaps she iswhispering on 200 just to mislead me . Who knows . You ve got to be wise as a serpent when youplay this game that s what you ve got to be . There s just two kinds of radio detectives thequick and the dead . He chuckled dryly . Well I guess Coles Masters will think I m one of the dead ones if I don t rush on . Hurrying to the next street he boarded a car to make his way back to the secret lower room_During his absence things had been happening in the mysterious radio world that hangs likea filmy ghost_land above the sleeping world_CHAPTER IVA GAME FOR TWOAs Curlie slipped noiselessly through the door into the secret tower room he was seized bythe arm and dragged into his chair . Man _ where have you been . It was Coles Masters . He spoke in an excited whisper . Listen tothat . It s the second message . He ll repeat it again . They always do . As Curlie listened his face grew grave with concern . The message came from the head stationof the radiophone secret service bureau . That station was located in New York . The messagewas a reprimand . Kindly friendly but firmly it told Curlie that for two nights now someonein his area had been breaking in on 600 . Coast_to_ship messages had been disturbed . Once anS . O . S_ from a disabled fishing schooner had barely escaped being lost . Something must bedone about it at once . By Curlie . In Chicago . With parted lips and bated breath Curlie listened to the message as it came to him in code_Then with trembling fingers he adjusted a lever touched a button turned a screw and dictatedto a station in another part of the city his answering O_K_ to the message . Of course he said to Coles as he lifted the receiver from his head that means that thisfellow that races all over the map has been at it again to_night . About an hour ago said Coles wrinkling his brow . What did you do about it . What was there to do . I tried to locate him . He danced about first here then there . I markedhis locations . They were never the same . See he pointed to the map . I numbered them . Hespoke from five different points . What did he say . It s all written down there Coles motioned to a pad . Can t make head nor tail to it . Somethingabout a map an airplane a boat and a lot of gold . What kind of voice . Sounded young . Some boy in late teens I d say . Though it might have been a girl . She mighthave changed her voice to disguise it . You can t tell . Had two cases like that in the lastthree weeks . You never can tell about voices . No said Curlie thoughtfully you never can tell . That s about the only thing you can besure of in this strange old world . You can always be sure that you never can tell . Thing thatlooks like one thing always turns out to be something else . Point is he continued after a moment s deep thought somebody s getting past our guard_Slamming us right in the nose and we re not doing a thing about it . Don t look like we could_I ve got a theory but you can t go searching the estate of the richest man in your city juston theory you ve got to have facts to back you up and mighty definite facts too . Yes that s right agreed Coles . But what do you make out of all that babble about airplane map ship and much gold . Do you suppose it s some smuggling scheme some plan to get a lotof Russian or Austrian jewels into the country without paying duty or something like that . I don t make anything out of that said Curlie rather sharply and for the time I don tjolly much care . The thing I m interested in is the fact that we re being beaten that theair about us is being torn to shreds every night by some careless or criminal person thatwe re getting a black eye and a reprimand from the department that sea traffic is being interrupted that lives are being imperiled and we can t seem to do anything about it . That s what s turningmy liver dark black . He pounded the desk before him until instruments rattled and wires sang . But how you are going to catch a fellow when he goes tearing all over the map said Curlie more calmly is exactly what I don t know . You go down and get a bite of chow . No go on homeand go to bed . I ll take the rest of the shift . I want to think . I think best when I m alone when the wires sing me a song when the air whispers to me out of the night when the ghostsof dead radio_men ghosts of operators who joked with death when the sea was reaching up mightyarms to drag them down come back to talk to me . That s when I think best . These whisperingghosts tell me things . When I sit here all asleep but my ears things seem to come to me . Bah _ said Coles Masters shivering you give me the creeps . Drawing on his coat he slipped out of the door leaving Curlie slumped down in his chair alreadyall asleep but his wonderful ears_For a full hour he sat lumped up there . Seeming scarcely to breathe stirring now and thenas in sleep he continued to listen and to dream_Then suddenly he sat up with a start to exclaim out loud . Yes . That s it . Catch a thief with a thief . Catch a radiophone with a radiophone . A radiophoneon wheels . That s a game two can play at . I ll do it . To_morrow night . Snapping up a telephone receiver he murmured . Central 662 . A moment later he tuned an instrument and threw on a switch Weightman there _ he inquired . Asleep . Wake him up . This is Curlie Carson . Yes it s important . No I ll tell you . Don tbother to wake him now _have him over at the Coffee Shop at five bells . The Coffee Shop . He llknow . Don t fail . It s important . He snapped down the receiver . Weightman was the radio mechanic assigned to his station . Hewould have unusual and important work to do that day_He slumped down again in his chair but did not remain in that position many minutes_From one of the loud speakers came a persistent whisper . Hello . Hello Curlie you there _ the girlish voice purred the one that had whispered tohim before . I saw you to_night . That was dangerous . Why did you do it . Nearly got me in bad_Not quite . He almost got you . The whisper ceased . Adjusting the campus coil Curlie sat at strained attention . I wish I knew you were listening came again . It s hard to be whispering into the nightand not knowing you re being heard . Curlie s fingers moved nervously over a tuner knob . He was sorely tempted to tune in and flashan answering O_K if nothing more_But no he drew his hands resolutely back . It was not wise . There was danger in it . This mightbe a trap . They might locate his secret tower room by that single O_K . Then disaster would follow_The whisper came again . You re clever Curlie awfully clever . The way you doubled over andturned yourself wrong side out was great . But please do be careful . It s big Curlie big _ again the whisper rose almost to speaking tone . And he is a terribly determined man wouldn tstop at anything . The whisper ceased_For a moment Curlie sat there lost in reflection then he muttered savagely . Oh _ get off theair you little whispering mystery you re spoiling my technique . Your very terrible frienddidn t send any message to_night and the one he sent before hasn t got us into any trouble_I ve got to forget you and go after this moving fellow who sends 600 . As if in answer to his challenge the loud speaker to his right the one tuned to 1200 beganto rattle . Then in the full determined tones of a man accustomed to speak with authoritythere came . Calm night . Three times over five thousand miles of air this great voice bellowed its message_The silence which followed was ghostly . Cold perspiration stood out on Curlie s brow_It was not necessary for him to calculate the location from which this message was sent . Heknew that it had come from the hotel . And it had . Next thing he told himself with a groan the International Service will be on my back forletting that lion roar . I ought to turn that over to the police but I won t not just yet . CHAPTER VIN THE DARKAs the clock in a distant college tower struck the hour of eleven the following night a flatlooking car with a powerful engine stole out into the road that ran by the Forest Preserve_It was the Humming Bird . Joe Marion was at the wheel . Curlie sat beside him_On the back of the car was a miscellaneous pile of instruments all securely clamped down . Abovethere hung suspended between two vertical bars a square frame from which there gleamed thecopper wires of a coil_To catch a radiophone on wheels Curlie had reasoned one must mount his radio compass on wheelsand pursue the offender . How well it would work he could not even guess but anything wasbetter than sitting there helpless in the secret tower room listening to this person tearingup the air in a manner both unwise and unlawful_So here they were prepared to make the test . Of course Curlie grumbled now we ve got the trap set the ghost may decide not to walkon this particular night . That ll be part of our rotten luck . Most ghosts I m told chuckled Joe prefer to walk when there s someone about for what sthe good of a ghost_walk when there s no one to see . So our radio ghost may show up after all . Curlie lapsed into silence . He was reviewing the events which led up to this thrilling moment_When the message on 600 came banging to his ears with great power on that first night he hadcarefully platted the various locations of the person who had sent the messages . There hadbeen some criss_crosses shown but in the main a line drawn through these points had formedan oblong which on the actual surface of the ground must have been some ten miles in lengthby six in width . One interesting point was that the first and last messages of that night hadbeen sent at points not a quarter of a mile apart . Which goes to show he reasoned that this fellow started from a certain point and madehis way back to that point just as a rabbit will do when chased by a hound . And those twopoints the start and the finish are close to the driveway into the million dollar estate_But of course that doesn t prove that the car came from there . Any person could drive to thatpoint begin operations race over the square and return to the point . Coles Masters had platted the points for the second night . A line drawn through these pointsmade a figure quite irregular in form which was however composed of rectangles . Which proves he told himself that our friend the lawless radio fan drives an auto andnot an airplane . An auto follows roads which for the most part in this section form squares_He passed along two or three sides of these squares and this makes up the figure . There s only one thing in common in the two night journeys he continued . The start andfinish are at almost exactly the same spot near the entrance of that great estate . He tried not to allow these facts to cause him to hold undue suspicion against the inhabitantsof that mansion but in this he experienced some difficulty . The thing for us to do he had said to Joe is to run out there and back our car into anunfrequented wooded road running into the forest preserve . We don t dare go too near the originalstarting place . If we re seen with this load of junk it will give us dead away . Thing is tobe ready to move quickly when he lets loose with his message . Ought not to be more than a mileaway I d say . He s got a powerful car . You can tell that by the fact that he sent a messageat this corner then raced over here four miles distant and got another message off in elevenminutes which is quick action . They backed into the grass_grown road of the Forest Preserve then settled down in their placesto wait_The night was dark . There was no moon . Clouds were scurrying overhead . Only the rustle of leavesand the startled tweet_tweet of some bird surprised in his sleep disturbed the utter silenceof the woods . Ghostly whispered Joe then he lapsed into silence_With his slim legs stretched out before him Curlie was soon asleep all but his ears . Joeinsisted that those ears never slept_A half hour an hour an hour and a half dragged by . Joe had gone quite to sleep when Curliesuddenly dug him in the ribs and uttered the shrilly whispered warning . Hist . There she blows . A flashlight was snapped on . Curlie s fingers flew from instrument to instrument . The voiceof the mysterious operator could be heard . Now rising now falling it filled the woods withechoes yet the speaker was more than a mile away as near as the boys could guess_The words spoken by him were now of no importance . Location was everything . Same place exclaimed Curlie exactly the same . You know where . Drive like mad . Instantly the car lurched forward . Coming out of the bush on two wheels she sent a showerof gravel flying as she rushed madly down the road_Quick as they were the quarry had been quicker . As they rounded a corner they caught thered gleam of a tail_light disappearing at the next turn . Heck _ said Curlie then Let her out . Show him some speed . The motor of the Humming Bird sang joyously . Fairly eating up the road she took the cornerwith a wide swing . But when they looked down the long stretch of highway there was no red tail_lightto be seen . Heck _ said Curlie again he s reached the next crossroad and turned the corner . Can t tellwhich way he went . It s a hard dry gravel roadbed _won t tell a thing . Best we can do is torattle along up there then sit it out for another listen_in . Disappointed but not disheartened Curlie adjusted his instruments then sat in breathlessexpectation_He did not have long to wait for again the voice in the loud speaker boomed out into the night . Huh he grumbled a few seconds later he s got three miles lead on us . To the right . Quick give her the gas . Again they were off . For two miles and a half straight ahead they raced . The Humming Bird quiveredlike a leaf instruments jingling in spite of their lashings . Make it all the way said Curlie as Joe slowed up . He s not there . Given us the slip again . Six times this program was gone through with . Not once in all that time did they catch sightof that tail_light . Some car he s got _ said Curlie when the farce was ended . Bet he never even guessed he wasbeing chased . But you wait we ll get him yet . When they were once more in the secret tower room Curlie plotted the route of the mysteriousoperator . Only significant thing about that he commented when he had finished is that he startsand finishes within a quarter of a mile of the same place as on the other two nights . And that place suggested Joe . Is near old J . Anson s driveway . Looks mighty suspicious to me said Joe . Does to me too but as I have said before you can t raid a man s private castle on anysuch flimsy proof as that . You ve got to have the goods . Tell you what he said after a moment s silence sometimes our natural ears and eyes arebetter than all these instruments and wires . I m going out there to_morrow night alone andon foot . Might work said Joe thoughtfully but whatever you do you must be careful . Careful _ said Curlie scornfully . There are times when a fellow can t afford to be careful_This thing s getting serious . He glanced over a second message from the head office of hisbureau . It was couched in no gentle terms . He was told that this intruder must be caught andthat at once if he Curlie Carson wished to hold his position as chief of the secret towerroom station_CHAPTER VIA REAL DISCOVERYDarkness found Curlie again on the edge of the Forest Preserve . This time he was on foot andalone . Apparently he carried nothing . His right hip pocket bulged the handle of a flashlightprotruded from his coat pocket that was all_He did not pause at the spot where they had hid their car the night before but continued downthe main road for a half mile farther . There he plunged into the forest to continue his journeyunder cover . Eleven o clock found him concealed in a clump of bushes in the woods that layopposite the millionaire s driveway . If they come to_night he whispered to himself I ll know whether they belong on that estateor not and if they do I ll know who it is . Anyway I ll know it s one of J . Anson s folks_And we ll see if it is a boy or the girl . The question interested him . He had no relish for getting a girl into trouble especially thatfrank_faced smiling girl he had seen on horseback . But the thing must stop he told himself sternly taking a tight grip on something in hiship pocket_The night was clear . He could see objects quite plainly . The trees the shrubbery the stonepillars at the entrance to the driveway stood out in bold relief . For a time he sat staringat them in silence . At last he closed his eyes and slept as was his custom all but his ears_He was startled from this stupor by a sudden flash of light which made its presence felt eventhrough his eyelids_As his eyes flew open he found himself staring at two glowing headlights . The next instanthe had flattened himself in the grass . Wow . Hope they didn t see me _ he whispered_A low_built powerful car had come purring so quietly down the driveway of the estate thatit had rounded a sudden curve before he had been aware of its presence_Now with undiminished speed it turned to the right entered the public highway and sped straighton_As Curlie rose from the grass to stare after it a low exclamation escaped his lips . Supportedby high parallel bars which were doubtless in turn supported by strong guy wires were theaerials of a radiophone . The whole of this rose from and rested upon the body of the powerfulroadster . And I missed them _ he exploded then . No I didn t . They re stopping . It was true . Some eighty rods down the road the car had slowed up . He had no means of tellingwhat they were doing but felt quite warranted in supposing they were sending a message_Like a flash he was away through the brush . Speed and the utmost caution were necessary . The fishing_boat i suppose is kept to cases of emergency thatGovernor may communicate you with the shore if careless . I fearedit might be moored so securely than i could not unfasten it . Securityhad made them necessary and the boat was tied merely against linesfor rings in the rock the object to keep from bruising her sidesby the stone any that to prevent then three taking her away . Coles Masters who was in charge of the secrettower room had his hands full . He switched on this loud_speaker and lowered that one to awhisper . He tuned in this one and cut that one out . Whew _ he exclaimed mopping his brow what a night . Wish Curlie were here . To start the night s entertainment a boy had broken in on the radio concert . Then a crank hadcome shouting right into the middle of a speech by a politician . A few moments later a messageon 1200 had fairly burst his ear_drums . The message had been short composed of just three words . Dark cloudy night . Regular thunderbolt behind that _ he muttered as he measured the location and found it tocome from the city s great hotel . Enough there to send it round the world . Shouldn t be surprisedto get the echo of it in a few seconds myself . The nerve of the man . In strange contrast to this was the whisper which followed within five minutes . It was sent on 200 . Hello Curlie . Did you get that . Terrible wasn t it _ came the whisper . But Curlie I don tthink you need to bother about him . He s leaving in a day or two . He s going far far away_He s going north out of your territory entirely . I know you d love to catch him Curlie butit would be dangerous awfully dangerous . So don t you try for he is going far far away . Coles Masters fingers had worked rapidly during this whispered message . Not only had he measuredthe distance and taken the location but he had written down the message word for word . Well I ll be jiggered _ he muttered . That was a girl a young girl and a pretty one too or I miss my guess . Anyway she has an interesting whisper . She s at that same hotel and seemsto know Curlie . She must have broken in on my 1200 friend . So he s going north . Can t go anytoo soon for me . Mighty queer case . Have to turn it over to Curlie . It s all Greek to me . Hello there . What He wheeled about to snap a button . A message was being shouted out on 600 . That s the chap Curlie s after . So he hasn t got him yet . Well here s hoping he hurries . His pencil began rapidly writing the message_Meanwhile Curlie in his woods retreat had moved silently over to the other side of the driveway . Probably will come back the other way he concluded_He did not remain behind the fence this time but threw himself into the shallow depths of adry ravine . He remained keenly alert . His eyes were constantly on the road which lay likea brown ribbon a full mile straight before him_He was thinking of his various cases . Equal in interest to the one which he was now huntingdown was that big hotel case . He was thinking of the girl . Why had she whispered those messagesto him . Was she merely a tool of the man behind the powerful radio machine . Was she simplyleading him on . He could not feel that she was . Somehow her whisper had an accent of genuineinterest in it . Wonder what she s like he asked himself . Then with a smile playing about his lips he triedto guess . Small very active has dark brown hair and snappy black eyes . After a moment s thought hechuckled . Probably really a heavy blonde something like two hundred pounds . You can t tellanything by a voice . You Suddenly he braced himself up on his elbows . His keen ears had caught a distant purring sound_Two yellow balls of fire were rapidly approaching _the headlights of a fast_moving automobile . He comes . Now for it . He prepared to spring_In an amazingly short time the car was all but upon him . Leaping to his feet he let out awild whoop and brandishing his automatic threateningly stood squarely in the middle of the road_His heart beat wildly . There could be no mistake . He saw the wires and rods swaying above the car_For a second the car slowed up then with a snort it leaped right at him . Nimble as he was he barely escaped being run down_As the car flashed past him he wheeled about and almost instantly his automatic barked threetimes . Simultaneous with the last shot there came a louder explosion . Tire . Got you he muttered_Instantly the car swerved to the side of the road . A tire had gone flat . The car had skidded_The rods which carried the aerials caught in a tree top . The car jerked back like a mad horsecaught by a lariat reared up on its hind wheels threatened to turn turtle then crashed overon its side with its engine still racing wildly_Sudden as had been the catastrophe it had not been too quick for the driver . Just as the carcrashed over Curlie caught sight of a figure in long linen duster and with closely wrappedhead dashing up the bank over the fence and into the brush . Go it he exclaimed making no attempt to catch the fugitive you know the country betterthan I do . I d never catch you in that labyrinth of trees . Besides I don t need to . Your equipmentis pretty well smashed up and you ve left me enough evidence to make out a beautiful case . Walking over to the machine he reached over and shut off the engine . After that in a veryleisurely manner he collected various odds and ends from the radiophone equipment . Having stuffedthese into his pockets he wrenched the back number plate from the machine and tucked it underhis arm . Guess that s enough he murmured . Now I can take my own time in springing the thing . Heprobably thinks I was a hold_up man but even if he guessed the truth he couldn t escape meand couldn t get his equipment back in shape short of a week so that s that . Turning he started toward the nearest interurban line a good five miles away_When he had walked a mile he stopped suddenly in his track . Say _ he exclaimed . Was that the son or the daughter . All muffled up that way I couldn t tell . Ho well he resumed his march that ll come out in time . Only I hope it wasn t the girl_I sort of liked her looks . CHAPTER VIICURLIE RECEIVES A SHOCKHaving boarded an interurban car Curlie slept his way into the city . Once there he hurriedover to the secret tower room where the news of his night s adventure was received with great joy . So you got him _ exclaimed Coles Masters . Smashed him up right . Bully for you . That s great . He slapped Curlie on the back_Dropping into his chair Curlie dictated a message by secret wire to headquarters in New York_The message stated in modest concise terms that the nuisance on 600 in the secret tower regionwas at an end that the station had been effectively broken up and that the offender wouldno doubt soon be in the hands of the law_A half hour later he received a highly commendatory message congratulating him on his achievementand bidding him keep up the good work_After glancing over Coles reports for the evening and making mental notes from them Curlieprepared to seek his bed and indulge in a good long sleep the first in several days . There isn t a bit of hurry in going after that rich young fellow or girl if it is a girl he said to Coles . That ll keep . We ve got plenty of proof . He jerked a thumb toward the cornerwhere was a box into which he had tossed the various small parts of a sending set and the numberplate of the car . All we need to do now is to saunter out there some fine morning and havea heart_to_heart talk with J . Anson himself . Had Curlie but known it there was to be a great deal more than that to it . There was to bean adventure in it for him such as he had never before experienced an adventure which wasdestined to take him thousands of miles from the secret tower room and which was to throw himinto such dangers as would cause the bravest to shrink back in terror_Since he was blissfully ignorant of all this he was also blissfully happy in the consciousnessof having achieved success in the thing he had undertaken . This he laughed as he said it is going to bring me face to face with one of America sgreatest millionaires . It s like going before a king in some ways . In others I fancy it s morelike meeting a lion in the street . Anyway I ve always wanted to meet a king a lion and amillionaire and here s where I meet one of them . Ever meet one . He turned to Coles . Meet which . Coles smiled . King lion or millionaire . Millionaire . No can t say that I have though I doubt if we d either of us recognize one if we shouldmeet him on the street . Someone has said that humanity is everywhere much the same and I fancythat s true even of very rich folks . They may try to bluff you with their power but if theyfind they can t do that I guess they ll turn out to have the same dreams the same hopes andfears the same joys and sorrows as the rest of us . Do you think so _ said Curlie thoughtfully . I hope that s true . It would be a good thingfor the world if it were true and if all the people in the world knew it . Well good night . He drew on his cap . See you in about sixteen hours . Guess it ll take methat long to catch up my sleep . After that I m going after that fellow who s breaking in on1200 that fellow over at the hotel with the whispering friend or enemy whichever she mayturn out to be . Had he but known it it was to be many days before he was to go after that offender on the1200 meter wave lengths and then it was to be in ways of which he had not yet dreamed . Andso he slept_When he awoke after fourteen hours of refreshing sleep it was to hear the newsies crying theirevening papers . For some time he lay there listening to their shrill shouts and attemptingto catch what they were saying . Ex_tree . All about He could get that far probably because he had heard it so often before but no further could he go . The remainder was a jumble of meaningless sounds_Suddenly as he listened a shrill urchin shouted the words out directly beneath his very window . Wul _ex_tree . All about the mur_der_ed millionaire s son . Here . Here _ exclaimed Curlie thrusting his head out of the window . What millionaire s son . Give me one of those papers . He tossed the boy a nickel and received a tightly wrapped paper_Sent through the window as if shot from a catapult it landed with a bump on the floor_His hand trembled so he could scarcely unroll the paper . His head whirled . Murdered _ he said to himself . Millionaire s son murdered . Can it be Vincent Ardmore . Dida bullet from my automatic glancing from the wheel inflict a mortal wound . He saw himself behind prison bars in murderer s row_Cold perspiration stood out on his brow as he read in staring headlines . J . ANSON ARDMORE S SON BELIEVED MURDERED . Believed . He caught at that single word as a camel in a desert snaps at a straw . So theywere not sure_Hastily he read the column through then dropped limply into a chair . Oh . What a shock _ he breathed_He was vastly relieved . The article stated that the car belonging to the millionaire s sonhad been found by a laborer employed on the estate as he came to his work very early in themorning . The car which was badly smashed up bore the mark of a bullet in a rear tire andone in the lower part of the body . It was believed that the young man being pursued by banditsand having attempted to escape had had his car riddled by bullets and had been thrown intothe ditch . There are grave reasons for supposing the article went on to state since no trace of theyoung man has yet been found that he has been either kidnapped for ransom or having beenkilled by a stray bullet has been buried somewhere in the forest preserve . Bands of armed men are searching the woods and every available police officer and detectivehas been put on the case . A reward of 5 000 has been offered by the father for any informationwhich may lead to the discovery of the whereabouts of his son . Whew _ exclaimed Curlie mopping his brow . What a rumpus . Suddenly he sat up straight . Doesn t say one word about that wireless apparatus in the car_How about that . He sat with wrinkled brow for a moment . Ah _ he slapped his knee I have it . The laborer of course came directly to his master . Theshrewd old millionaire guessing that his son had been breaking radio laws had all of thatequipment removed before the public was let in on the deal . He bribed the laborer to secrecyon that point and there you are . Again his brow wrinkled . Five thousand dollars _ he whispered . That s a lot of money . I couldsupply some valuable information which might entitle me to the five thousand . Question is do I want to risk it . The thing that s happened is about this far as I can figure it out Our young amateur radio friend when his auto turned turtle hiked off into the woods . Fora time he stayed there . Then when nothing happened for some time he came sneaking back . Whenhe found I d taken his number plate and some parts of his radio equipment he guessed rightaway that I was connected with the radio secret service . He s hiding right now unless I missmy guess with some of his rich young friends . I might tell all that and I might get the reward but supposing something really had happened . Oh boy what a mess . And yet he mused after a moment I ve done nothing to be ashamed of . I m an officer ofthe law . I did what I did because a fellow was resisting arrest . Ho well I ll just let thingsstand and simmer . Something may come to the top yet . CHAPTER VIIICURLIE MEETS A MILLIONAIREIt was a tense situation for Curlie . He spent an uneasy night and that in spite of the factthat the air was particularly free from trouble . Hang it all he exclaimed once as dashing the receiver from his head he sprang from hischair to pace the floor of the secret tower room I d welcome something in the line of trouble_This eternal thinking _thinking _thinking drives me wild . What to do that s the question_Suppose I d ought to go out and tell Ardmore what I know . If a millionaire father s like anyother father I guess he s pretty well wrought up by now . But if I go and if I tell him thewhole truth I m as sure as I am of anything that it will get me into a mess and that s thesort of thing I don t like . Glancing down his eye was caught by Coles report of the night before . Dropping once moreinto his chair he began going through the messages written there . When he came to the onesent out by the boy whose car he had wrecked he pondered over it for a long time . Island airplane map much gold airplane map island gold he repeated . What doesone make out of that . It might be that this boy has been planning a secret voyage with someother chap . Certainly sounds like it . Other messages were the same kind . By Jove . Perhaps he sskipped out and gone on that trip and is not hiding out at all . Let s see . Taking down a file he drew forth a bunch of message records clipped together . They were thosesent by the moving operator on 600 the millionaire s son_A long time he studied over these . Seems to sort of prove my theory he muttered once . Can t be sure though . Then suddenly he sat up straight . That s the idea . He slapped his knee . The very thing . Why didn t I think of that before . If he doesn t shew up by morning I ll do it . I ll just takethese records over to Ardmore and suggest to him that they may shed some light on the subject_Don t need to tell him I was in on the wrecking of the car at all . That wouldn t help any_These records might . And if I can help to find him and bring him back then oh boy . Oh youbaby fortune . Five thousand big red round dollars . He sat back trying to measure the meaning of the possession of five thousand dollars whichdid not have to be spent for bed board and clothing . At last he gave it up in despair_The morning papers assured the interested city that the son of their money king was still missing_To make sure that this report was correct Curlie called up the mansion and inquired aboutit . When he learned that it was indeed true he requested the servant who answered the telephoneto inform the millionaire that a representative of the Secret Service of the Air would arriveat his residence with copies of certain radiophone messages sent out by his son previous tohis mysterious disappearance which might shed some light on the subject_Shortly after that he leaped into the driver s seat on the Humming Bird and motored away tothe west_Arrived at the Forest Preserve he backed the car into the deserted roadway in the forest atthe very spot where he and Joe had concealed themselves the night of the race . Have to leave you here old thing he whispered . If a fellow were to pull up that drivewayin such a rakish craft as you are they might think him crazy and throw him out . Well here goes he whispered to himself as having rounded the last clump of decorativeshrubbery he came in sight of the red stone mansion . Whew . What a stunner _ whispered Curlie to himself_The sun was tipping the parapets of that mansion with gold the dew sparkled on the perfectlykept green . It was indeed a beautiful picture_Tiptoeing up the steps he was about to lift the heavy bronze knocker when a porter openedthe door and motioned him to enter . Are you the man _ he asked in a low tone . I m the boy who wired about the messages . Step right this way . He s waiting . Curlie s heart beat fast . Was he to be ushered at once into the august presence of the magnate . He had pictured to himself hours of waiting interviews by private secretaries and all that_And yet here he was . In a large room furnished in rich mahogany seemingly the rich man s homeoffice he was being greeted by a stout broad_shouldered brisk and healthy_looking man whowas assuring him that he was speaking to J . Anson Ardmore himself and inviting him to sit down_With his head in a whirl he managed to get himself into a chair . And all this while he wastelling himself things things like this . Curlie old boy this is going to be strenuous_This man is powerful magnetic almost hypnotizing . He will find out as much as he can fromyou . He will tell as little as is necessary to attain his end . To him all life is a game agame in which he conceals much and discovers all that lies in his opponent s hand . He probablyknows you have the goods on his son . Perhaps he is merely playing a game about this vanishingson . He may know where he is all the time . If so he ll want to know what you know and whatyou are going to do . You must be wise _wise as a serpent . Well _ the magnate spoke in a brisk way . My butler tells me you have some messages . Yes sir . Sent by my missing son . Yes sir . And may I ask the magnate s face was a mask not a muscle moved how you happened to bein possession of these messages . Curlie could hear his own heart beat but he held his ground . Since I am attached to the governmentradiophone staff it is my duty to catch and record all unfair and illegally sent messages to record them as evidence and for future reference . Curlie fancied he saw the man start . The words that followed were spoken still in a cold collectedtone . These messages you say were unfair . Unfair and illegally sent . How illegal . They were sent with exceedingly high power and on 600 meter wave lengths . Such high poweris unlawful for all amateurs and the use of 600 is granted to ships and ship stations alone . Ah . For a second the man appeared to reflect . Then suddenly . We are wasting time . My son has mysteriously disappeared . I have reason to fear foul play_Let me assure you that I know nothing about his whereabouts and previous to this moment thatI have known nothing regarding these illegally sent messages . But began Curlie . You doubt my word his voice grew stern and hard as he read the incredulity in Curlie s eyes . Young man he fairly thundered fix this in your mind . No man ever has risen or ever willrise to my present position through treachery or deceit . When I say a thing is so by thunderit _is_ so . He struck his desk a terrific blow . But a Curlie caught himself just in time . He had been about to reveal the fact that he was awareof the presence of the wireless set in the auto the night the millionaire s son disappeared . I can t see just how your messages could aid us in finding my son . The magnate spoke morecalmly . However all things are possible . May I see the copies . Of course said Curlie hesitatingly this is a private matter . Few persons know of ourservice . It is the desire of the government that they should not know . These are not for publication_Do you understand that . You have my word . Curlie passed the sheath of papers over the desk_Slowly one by one the great man read them . His movement was not hurried . He digested everyword . Like many another great man he had formed the habit of gathering as far as possible the full meaning of any set of facts by his own careful research before allowing his opinionto be influenced by others_He had gone half through the pack when a door over at the right opened and a girl dressedin some filmy stuff which brought out the smoothness of her neck and arms and the beauty ofher complexion entered the room_Curlie caught his breath . It was the girl he had seen on the horse that morning the magnate sdaughter_She had advanced halfway to her father s desk before she became aware of Curlie s presence_Then she started back with a stammered . I _I beg your pardon . It s all right . The first smile Curlie had seen on the great man s face now curved abouthis mouth . You may remain . This is no secret chamber . Fa _father she faltered gripping at her throat does he know _know anything _about _aboutVincent . I can t tell yet . I am going over the messages . Please be seated . The girl sank into a deep leather_cushioned chair . Without looking at her Curlie was awareof the fact that she was studying him perhaps trying to make up her mind where she had seenhim before . This made him exceedingly uncomfortable . He was greatly relieved when at last themagnate spoke . Gladys he addressed the girl did you say you found some sort of map in Vincent s room . Oh yes she sprang to her feet . A photograph of a very strange looking map and also oneof some queer foreign writing . Will you run and get those photographs . Yes father . It s strange the older man mused after she had gone . I don t understand it at all . Thesemessages they are If you please Curlie broke in . Wait _ commanded the other holding up his hand for silence . Let us have no opinions beforeall of the evidence is in . That map may aid us in forming correct conclusions . CHAPTER IXA MYSTERIOUS MAPIt was indeed a curious map which had been reproduced on the large photographic print whichGladys Ardmore placed on the desk before her father_Motioning Curlie to come forward and examine it with them the magnate rose from his chairto bend over the map . As Curlie stood there looking down at it the girl in her eagerness bentdown so close to him that he felt her warm breath on his cheek_Nothing however could have drawn his gaze from that map . Wrinkled torn in places patched browned with age smirched by many finger marks all of which were faithfully reproduced bythe freshly printed photograph it still gave promise of revealing many a mystery if one couldbut read it correctly_It showed both land and water . Here on the land was a picture of a castle and there on thewater a ship . The shore of the land was not drawn as are maps with which we are in these daysfamiliar but was cut up in curious geometric forms which surely could not faithfully representthe true lines of the shore . Towns were shown but only on the shoreline their names printedin by hand in such small letters as would require a magnifying glass to read them . Crossingand recrossing the water in every conceivable direction were innumerable straight lines . Aboutthe edge of the map were eight faces of children . Their cheeks puffed out as if blowing theyappeared to represent the wind that blew from certain quarters_All the writing was in some foreign language . In the lower left_hand corner was what appearedto be the name of the maker but this was so blotted out as to be unreadable . Huh . The magnate straightened up . That s a strange map and appears to be very ancient butI can hardly see how it is going to help us with our present problem . There is still the writing suggested Gladys turning over the other photograph . That said Mr . Ardmore after a moment s study of it is written in some strange tongueand is I take it unintelligible to us all . It s a photograph of the back of the map suggested Curlie pointing out certain spots wherethe wrinkles and tears were the same . My French teacher will be here at ten o clock . He knows several languages . Perhaps he couldhelp us suggested Gladys . We will leave that to him said her father . Now about these messages he went on turningto Curlie . What is your theory . Stammeringly Curlie proceeded to explain the idea which had come to him the notion that VincentArdmore and some pal of his had been planning a secret trip of some sort . That is entirely possible said Ardmore . Vincent is daring even rash at times .

Butwhen I get back I ll investigate . There may be something big there just as she says thereis . Yes I ll look into it when I get back _if I do get back . He shivered as he caught the howl of the wind in the rigging . Then tuning his instrument backto 600 he listened once more for some message from the seaplane the _Stormy Petrel__CHAPTER XVS . O . S_The spot of light which raced across the waters of the sea where no land was to be seen wherethe black surface of the swiftly changing waters shone always beneath the occupants of theseaplane took on an ever widening circle . There appeared to be no end to Alfred Brightwood sbelief that somewhere in the midst of all this waste of waters there was an island_Vincent Ardmore had long since given up hope of becoming rich by this mad adventure . His onlyhope the one that gave strength to his arms benumbed by long clinging to the flashlight andnew sight to his eyes weary with watching was that they might discover some bit of land a coral island perhaps where they might find refuge from the sea until a craft called totheir aid might rescue them_The thought of returning to the mainland he had all but abandoned . The gas in the tank wastoo low for that at least he was quite certain it must be_There was a chance of course that if they alighted upon the water and sent out an S . O . S the international call for aid they would be answered by some near_by ship . But this seemedonly a remote possibility . He dared not hope it would happen . They were far from any regularcourse of trans_Atlantic vessels and too far from shore to be picked up by a coast vessel ora fishing smack . The very fact that this island marked so plainly on the ancient map hadbeen in this particular spot so remote from the main sea_roads had strengthened their beliefthat during all the centuries of travel it had been lost from man s memory and hidden fromhis view . Now this very isolation since they were unable to locate this island if indeedit existed at all threatened to be their undoing_Still they circled and circled with great untiring sweeps . At last releasing the searchlight Vincent put his lips to a speaking tube . Let s light he grumbled . I m dead . What s the use . What else can we do but keep looking . Alfred answered . Take a look at the gas . Maybe it will carry us back . Even as he spoke a strange thing happened . The air appeared suddenly to have dropped frombeneath the plane . Straight down for fifty feet she dropped_With the utmost difficulty Alfred succeeded in preventing her from taking a nose dive into the sea . She _she bumped he managed to pant at last . Something the matter with the air . And indeed there was something about the atmospheric conditions which they had not sensed_Busy as they had been they had not seen the black bank of clouds to the northeast of them_With the wild rush of air from sheer speed they had not felt the increasing strength of thegale . Once Vincent had fancied that the sea far beneath them seemed disturbed but so farbeneath them was it that he could not tell_Now in surprise and consternation as if to steady his reeling brain he gripped the fuselagebeside him while he shrilled into the tube . Look . Look over there . Lightning . Watch out I m going down warned the other boy . Going to light . To do this was no easy task . Three times they swooped low to skim along just over the crestof the waves only to tilt upward again . Looks bad grumbled the young pilot_The fourth time he dared it . With the spray spattering his goggles he sent the plane rightinto the midst of it . For a second it seemed that nothing could save them that the wave theyhad nose_dived into would throw their plane end for end and land her on her back with hertwo occupants hopeless prisoners strapped head down to drown beneath her_But at last the powerful motors conquered and tossed by the ever increasing swells the planerode the sea like the stormy petrel after which she had been named . Quick _ exclaimed Alfred as the motors ceased to throb . Strip off your harness and get backto the tank . A moment later Vincent was making a perilous journey to the gas tank . Twice the wind all butswept him into the sea once a wave drenched him with its chilling waters . When at last hereached his destination it was only to utter a groan more gas had been used than he had daredthink . Can t _can t make it he mumbled as he struggled back to his place . Have to send out an S . O . S_ then . What wave length do you use . You ought to know exclaimed Vincent almost savagely . You were the one who insisted on usingit when we were making up our plans . Six hundred . Oh yes Alfred said indifferently . Well what of it . Just this much of it said Vincent thoughtfully . I ve been going over and over it in mymind the last little while . What if we send out our S . O . S_ now and some selfish landlubbersuch as we were is talking about matters of little importance and muddles our message . We mightbe left to drown . Aw can that sob stuff grumbled Alfred angrily . Are you going to send that S . O . S_ or am I . I will said Vincent preparing to climb to a position on the plane above him where the radiophonewas located . But _he suddenly began to sway dizzily but where are we . He sank back into his seat . For a full moment with the waves tossing the plane about and theblack clouds mounting higher and higher the two boys stared at one another in silence . Yes where were they . Who could tell . They were not trained mariners . They could not have takena reckoning even had they been in possession of the needed instruments . Why said Alfred hesitatingly we must be somewhere near that spot where the island wassupposed to be located . That s as near as we can come to it . Send out that latitude and longitude then we ll climb back into the air . We ll be safer there than on the water and we can keepthe searchlight shooting out flashes in all directions . A ship coming to our aid will see thelight . If they come Vincent whispered . Hurry _ exclaimed Alfred as a giant wave rising above its mates threatened to tear theirplane into shreds_With benumbed and trembling fingers the boy unwrapped his instruments adjusted a coil twisteda knob and threw in his switch . Then his heart stood still . The motor did not start . Had itbeen dampened and short_circuited . Would it refuse to go . Were they already lost . Just as he was giving up in despair there came a humming sound and a moment later the well_knownsignal of distress had been flashed out across the waves . Three times he repeated it . Threetimes in a few sharp words he told their general location and their plight . Then with wildlybeating heart he pressed the receivers to his ears and awaited a reply_A moment passed two three four but there came no answering call . Only the buzz and snapof the ever_increasing static greeted his straining ears_Once more he sent out the message again he listened . Still no response . C m on came from the boy below . It s getting dangerous . You can get a message off in theair . Gotta get out o here . Gotta climb . May not be able to make it even now . As the other boy glanced down at the white_capped waves all about them he realized that hiscompanion spoke the truth_Hurriedly rewrapping his instruments all but the receivers which by the aid of an extensionhe brought down with him he made his way to his seat and strapped on his harness . All right he breathed_Once more the motors thundered . For a long distance they raced through blinding spray . Littleby little this diminished until with a swoop like a sea gull the magnificent plane shot upward_The next instant they felt a dash of cold rain upon their cheeks . Was the storm upon them . Or was this merely a warning dash which had reached them far in advance of the deluge . Forthe moment they could not tell_CHAPTER XVIA CONFESSIONFor an hour Curlie Carson had been seated in the radiophone cabin of the _Kittlewake_ . Duringthat time his delicately adjusted amplifier and his wonderful ears had enabled him to pickup many weird and unusual messages . Listening in at sea before a great storm is like wanderingon the beach after that same storm you never can tell what you may pick up . But though fragmentsof many messages had come to him not one of any importance to the _Kittlewake_ had reachedhis ears . If during that time any message from the _Stormy Petrel_ had been sent out it hadbeen lost in the crash and snap of static which now kept up a constant din in his ears_Again doubt assailed him . He had no positive knowledge that the boys in the plane had gonein search of that mysterious island of the old chart . They might for all he knew be at thismoment enjoying a rich feast on some island off the coast of America . Cuba for instance he told himself . Not at all impossible . Being damp state that code cable might have just had to be all in absurd and there were rolling that they followed him talk how did he . If he werein people he must be almost be to be spoken to life must be heard of mattress which shouted broad he are being heard that some eyes there were far ondweller alongside farmstead .

Once he fancied he caught a glimpseof a white hand above a wave . He could not be sure it might have been a speck of foam . Onlyone thing he could be sure of his throbbing brain told it to him over and over . Alfred Brightwood his friend was gone _gone forever . The sea had swallowed him up_CHAPTER XXITHE BOATS ARE GONEWhen Curlie Carson had fastened the mysterious post_shaped affair to the springs of his berth he fought his way against wind waves and darkness back to the radiophone cabin . Anything come in _ he asked as he shook the dampness from his clothing . Nothing I could make out shouted Joe . Got something all jumbled up with static once butcouldn t make it out . Rising he took the receiver from his head and handed it to Curlie_Then as the craft took a sudden plunge he leaped for a seat . Missing it he went sprawlingupon the floor_In spite of the seriousness of their dilemma the girl let forth a joyous peal of laughter_Joe s antics as he attempted to rise were too ridiculous for words_There was tonic for all of them in that laugh . They felt better because of it_Some moments after that save for the wild beat of the storm there was silence . Then clappingthe receivers to his ears Curlie uttered an exclamation . He was getting something or at leastthought he was . Yes now he did get it a whisper . Faint indistinct mingled with static yet audible enough there came the four words . Hello there Curlie . Hello . At that moment the currents of electricity playing from cloud to cloud set up such a rattleand jangle of static that he heard no more . It s that girl in my old home town in that big hotel he told himself . To think that herwhisper would carry over all those miles in such a gale . She s sending on 600 . Wonder why . Ah well he breathed when nothing further had come in I ll unravel that mystery in goodtime providing we get out of this mess and get back to that home burg of ours . But now Suddenly he started and stared . There had come a loud bump against the cabin then anotherand another . It s the boats _ he shouted . They ve torn loose . Should have known they would . Should havethought of that . Here . He handed the receiver to Joe and once more dashed out into the storm_The _Kittlewake_ carried two lifeboats . As he struggled toward where they should have been some object swinging past him barely missed his head_Instantly he dropped to the deck at the same time gripping at the rail to save himself frombeing washed overboard . That he told himself was a block swinging from a rope . The boat on this side is gone_Worse luck for that . We _we might need em before we re through with this . Slowly he worked his way along the rail toward the stern . Now and again the waves that washedthe deck lifted him up to slam him down again . Quit that _ he muttered hoarsely . Can t you let a fellow alone . Arrived at last on the other side he rose to his knees and tried to peer above him to theplace where the second lifeboat should be swinging . A flash of lightning aided his vision_A groan escaped his lips . Gone _ he muttered . Should have thought of that . But he told himself there s still the raft . The raft built of boards and gas_filled tubes was lashed to the deck forward . Thither hemade his difficult way_To his great relief he found the raft still safe . Since it was thrashing about he uncoileda rope closely lashed to the side of a cabin and with tremendous effort succeeded in makingthe raft snug . There now you ll remain with us for a spell he muttered_Clinging there for a moment he appeared to debate some important question . Guess I ought to do it he told himself at last . And I d better do it now . You never cantell what will happen next and if worst comes to worst it s our only chance . Fighting his way back to his cabin he returned presently with the post_shaped affair whichhe had lashed to the springs of his berth_This he now lashed to the stout slats of wood and crossbars of metal on the raft . When he hadfinished it appeared to be part of the raft . There my sweet baby he murmured sleep here rocked on the cradle of the deep until yourpapa wants you . You re a beautiful and wonderful child . Then weary water_soaked chilled to the bone stupefied by the wild beat of the storm achingin every muscle but not downhearted he fought his way back to the radio cabin Nature has been kind to man . She has so made him that he is incapable of feeling all the tragedyand sorrow of a terrible situation at the time when it bursts upon him . Vincent Ardmore ashe clung to the wrecked plane with his companion gone from him forever did not sense thefull horror of his position . He realized little more than the fact that he was chilled to thebone and that the wind and waves were beating upon him unmercifully_Then gradually there stole into his benumbed mind the thought that he might improve his position_The platform above him still stood clear of the waves . Could he but loosen the straps whichbound him to the fuselage could he but climb to that platform he would at least be free fora time from the rude beating of the black waters which rolled over him incessantly_With the numbed trembling fingers of one hand he struggled with the stubborn water_soakedstraps while with the other he clung to the rods of the rigging . To loosen his grip for aninstant once the straps were unfastened meant almost certain death_After what seemed an eternity of time the last strap gave way and with a wild pounding ofhis heart he gripped the rods and began to climb_As he tumbled upon the platform new hope set the blood racing through his veins . There might yet be a chance he murmured almost joyfully the storm is breaking . His eyeswandered to the fleeting clouds . Dawn s coming too . I _I _why I might send a message . Themotor s gone dead of course but there are still storage batteries . If only the insulationsare good . If water has not soaked in anywhere . With trembling fingers he tested the batteries . A bright flash of fire told him they were stillalive . Then with infinite care he adjusted the instruments . At last he tapped a wire and agrating rattle went forth . She s still good he exulted_Then slowly distinctly he talked into the transmitter talked as he might had he been surroundedby the cozy comforts of home . He gave his name the name of his aircraft told of his perilousposition gave his approximate location and asked for aid . Only once his voice broke and fellto a whisper . That was when he tried to tell of the sad fate of his companion_Having come to the end he adjusted the receiver to his ears and sat there listening_Suddenly his face grew tense with expectation . He was getting something an answer to his message_For a full moment he sat there tense motionless . Then suddenly without warning a new catastropheassailed him . A giant wave leaping high came crashing down upon the wreckage of the plane_There followed a snapping and crashing of braces . When the wave had passed the platform towhich he clung floated upon the sea . His radiophone equipment was water_soaked submerged_His storage batteries had toppled over to plunge into the sea_So there he clung a single individual on a mass of wreckage helpless and well_nigh hopelessin the midst of a vast ocean whose waves were even now subsiding after a terrific storm_CHAPTER XXIITHE WRECK OF THE _KITTLEWAKE_ I m getting a message _ exclaimed Curlie excitedly . Getting it distinct and plain and it s _it sfrom them . Oh is it _ the girl sprang from the seat . From your brother . They ve been wrecked . They re not on an island but on the sea . Safe though only he paused to listen closely again I can t just make out what he says about his companion . Oh . Please please let me listen . Gladys Ardmore gripped his arm_Quickly Curlie snatched the receiver from his head and pressed it down over her tangled massof brown hair_She caught but a few words then the voice broke suddenly off but such words as they were such words of comfort . The voice of her only brother had come stealing across the storm toher assuring her that he was still alive that there was still a chance that he might be saved_She pressed the receivers to her ears in the hopes of hearing more_In the meantime Curlie was answering the message . In quiet reassuring tones he gave theirlocation and told of their purpose in those waters and ended with the assurance that if itwere humanly possible the rescue should be accomplished . And we will save them he exclaimed . At least we ll save your brother . You don t think Gladys did not finish . I hardly know what to think about your brother s chum Curlie said thoughtfully . But thiswe do know . Your brother is clinging to the wreckage of a seaplane out there somewhere . Andwe will save him . See _ the storm is about at an end and morning is near . He pointed to thewindow where the first faint glow of dawn was showing_For a moment all were silent . Then suddenly without warning there came a grinding crash thatsent a shudder through the _Kittlewake_ from stem to stern . What was that _ exclaimed Joe Marion springing to his feet from the floor where he had beenthrown . We struck something . Curlie was out upon the deck like a shot_He all but collided with the skipper who had deserted his wheel . We it somethin shouted the skipper an she s sinkin by the larboard bow . Gotta gitoff er quick . Boats are gone . Everythin s gone . No said Curlie calmly the raft forward is safely lashed on . The engineer appeared from below . The engine had already ceased its throbbing . She s fillin fast he commented in a slow drawl . You two get the raft loose said Curlie . I ll get the girl . Dashing to his stateroom he seized two blankets and a large section of oiled cloth . With thesehe dashed to the radio room . Got to get out quick _ he exclaimed_Before she could realize what he was doing he had seized the girl and had wrapped her roundand round with the blankets then with the oiled cloth . Joe had rushed out to help with theraft . Curlie carried the girl outside and when the raft with the others aboard was afloat handed her down to the skipper . Try and keep her dry he said calmly . We ll all get soaked but we can stand it for a longtime a girl can t . Now push off _ he commanded . Get good and clear so that the wreck will not draw you down . You ll come with us said the skipper sternly . Curlie had not intended going with them . Hehad meant to remain behind and send a call for aid then to swim for the raft . But now ashe saw the water gaining on the stricken craft he realized how dangerous and futile it wouldbe . He was needed on the raft to help get her away . Having seen all this at a flash he said . All right I ll go . Having dropped to the raft and seized a short paddle he joined Joeand the engineer in forcing the unwieldy raft away from the side of the doomed _Kittlewake__They were none too soon for scarcely two minutes could have elapsed when with a rush thatnearly engulfed them the boat keeled up on end and sank from sight . And now said Joe addressing Curlie as he settled back to a seat on one of the gas_filledtubes you can test out what you said once about keeping your radiophone dry and tuned upunder any and every circumstance . Suppose you tune her up now and get off an S_O_S . There was a smile on the lips of the undaunted young operator as he said with a drawl . Give me time Joe old scout give me time . The girl staring out from her wrappings appeared to fear that the two boys had gone deliriousover this new catastrophe_But only brave and hardy spirits can joke in the midst of disaster and as for Curlie he reallydid have one more trick up his sleeve_As the old skipper sat staring away at the point where his craft had disappeared beneath thedark waters he murmured . Twasn t much we it fragment from an iceberg er somethin but twas enough . An a goodlittle craft she was too . The storm had passed but the waves were still rolling high . The raft tilted to such an anglethat now they were all in danger of being pitched headforemost into the sea and now in dangerof falling backward into the trough of the waves_Soaked to the skin shivering miserable the boys and men clung to the raft while the girlbewailed the fact that she was not permitted to suffer with them . Wrapped as she was and carefullyguarded from the on_rush of the waves she escaped all the miserable damp and chill of it . Shows you re a real sport Curlie s lips blue with cold attempted a smile but you vegot to let us play the gentleman even out here . When the waves had receded somewhat Curlie began digging at one of the tubes beneath his feet_Having at length unfastened it he stood it on end to unscrew some fastenings and lift off the top . Canisters of water and some emergency rations _ exclaimed Joe as he peered inside . Great stuff . They had taken a swallow of water apiece and were preparing to munch some hardtack and chocolatewhen Gladys exclaimed . Look over there . What s that . There s nothing said the engineer after studying the waves for a moment . Oh yes there was _ the girl insisted emphatically . Something showed up on the crest of awave . It s in the trough of the wave now . It ll come up again . Bit of wreckage from our yacht suggested Joe . Not much wreckage on er said the skipper . All washed off er long before she sank . What could it be then . The girl was fairly holding her breath . It couldn t be Don t get your hopes up too high cautioned Curlie . Of course miracles do happen but notso very often . CHAPTER XXIIITHE MIRACLEThey were all straining their eyes when at last the thing appeared once more on the crest ofthe wave . Wreckage . A mass of it _ came from the skipper . And _and there s a hand _ exclaimed Curlie . The paddles boys . The paddles . Every and of you hup an at it shouted the skipper_The wildest excitement prevailed yet out of it all there came quick and concerted action_Three paddles flashed as straining every muscle they strove to bring the clumsy raft nearerthe wreck . With tears in her eyes the girl begged and implored them to unwrap her and allowher to have a hand in the struggle_A minute passed . No longer chilled but steaming from violent exertion they strained eagereyes to catch another glimpse of the wreck . There _there it is _ exclaimed the girl overcome with joy . You re gaining . You re gaining . Five minutes passed . They gained half the distance . Eight minutes more the hand on the wreckagerose again . They were getting nearer_Suddenly the girl uttered a piercing cry of joy . It is Vincent . It is . It is . And she was right . A moment later as they dragged the all but senseless form from the seaplane they recognized him at once as the millionaire s son_He had drifted in the benumbing water so long that had they been delayed for another hour theywould have found nothing more than a corpse awaiting them_As Curlie tore Vincent s sodden outer garments from him he saw the girl carefully unrollingthe blankets and oiled covering from about her . He did not protest . To him the thought of seeingthis girl half drowned and chilled through by the spray which even now at times dashed overthe raft was heartbreaking but he knew it was necessary if the life of her brother was tobe saved . Brave girl _ he murmured as he wrapped Vincent in the coverings and passed him on to the skipper . And now he said the time has come to think of other things . I believe the waves have sufficientlysubsided to enable us to dare it . He fumbled once more at the raft at last to bring up a long post_shaped affair . More rations murmured Joe swallowing his last bite of hardtack a regular commissary_But why get them out at this time . You wait smiled Curlie_He was standing up . After telling Joe to steady him he began tearing away at the upper endof the mysterious package . In a moment he took out some limp rubber affairs . Toy balloons jeered Joe . Something like that Curlie smiled_He next brought out a small brass retort and a tiny spirit lamp . Lucky our matches are dry he murmured after unwrapping some oiled cloth and lighting thespirit lamp with one of the matches inclosed_After firmly tying the end of a toy balloon over the mouth of the retort he held the spiritlamp beneath the bowl of the retort . At once the balloon began to expand . Chemicals already in the retort he explained_When the balloon was sufficiently inflated he quickly tied it at the mouth then began inflatinganother . The gas is very buoyant he explained . Hold that he said as he passed the string to theengineer . There s enough he said quietly when the third had been filled_He next drew forth some shiny fine copper wire coiled about some round insulated bars_When he had fastened the balloons to one end of the bars he attached a strong cord to theballoons then allowed them to rise at the same time paying out the strands of copper wire . Not very heavy wire for an aerial he remarked but heavy enough . We ll have a perpendicularaerial which is better than horizontal and it ll hang pretty high . All that s in our favor . When the balloons had risen to a height which allowed the aerial to which was attached a heavierinsulated wire to float free he gave the cord to the engineer and began busying himself atputting together what appeared to be a small windmill with curved brass fans . A windmill he explained is the surest method of obtaining a little power . Always a littlebreeze floating round . Enough to turn a wheel . This one is connected direct with a small generator_Gives power enough for a radiophone . Might use batteries but they might go dead on you . Windmilland generator is as good after ten years as ten days . There you are he heaved a sigh of relief as he struck the transmitter which he had takenfrom his apparently inexhaustible bag of tricks . Unless I miss my guess we have a perfectly good radiophone outfit of fair power . All therest of it is stowed down there in the bottom . We should be heard distinctly at from a hundredto five hundred miles . In the future he smiled every lifeboat and raft will be equippedwith one of these handy little radiophone outfits which are really not very expensive . Then with all eyes fixed upon him he began to converse with the unseen and unknown who sailing somewhere on that vast sweep of water were they hoped to become their rescuers_In perfectly natural tones he spoke of their catastrophe and their present predicament . Hegave their approximate location and the names of their party . This after an interval of twominutes he repeated_Then suddenly his lips parted in a smile . The others watched him with strained attention_After a minute had elapsed he said with apparent satisfaction . We ll await your arrival with unmixed pleasure . The Steamship Torrence he explained in crossing the Atlantic was driven two hundred milesoff her course . She is now only about seventy_five miles from us . Being a fast boat she shouldreach us in three or four hours . And now he said with a smile since we have no checker_board on deck and are entirely deprivedof musical instruments of any kind perhaps you would like to hear me tell why I was sure themysterious island which has caused us so much grief did not exist . By the way he said turning to Vincent do you chance to have the original of that old mapwith you . The boy pointed to his aviator s sodden leather coat . Although he had gained much strengthfrom the warm blankets he had found himself unable to speak of the tragedy which had befallenhis companion on the _Stormy Petrel_ . Now as he saw Curlie draw the water_soaked map from thepocket of his coat a look of horror overspread his face and he muttered hoarsely . Throw it into the sea . It brings nothing but bad luck . No no said Curlie we won t do that . Then you must keep it the other boy exclaimed . I don t want ever to see it again . Alfredmade me a present of it just before we hopped off . All right said Curlie but you are parting with a thing of some value . Value _ exclaimed Vincent . Then he sat staring at Curlie in silence as much as to say . Youtoo must have been bitten by the gold_bug . But that Curlie had not been bitten by that dangerousand poisonous insect will be proved I think by the pages which follow_CHAPTER XXIVTHE STORY OF THE MAP You see said Curlie tapping the soggy bit of vellum which he held in his hand the troublewith this map is not that it is not genuine but that it s too old . This map he paused foremphasis this map was made in fourteen hundred and forty_six . Gladys Ardmore gasped . Her brother stared in astonishment . It s a fact _ declared Curlie emphatically . You see he went on the day I was in the library with Miss Gladys I saw an exact reproductionof this map in a large volume . At the same time I read a description of it and a brief accountof its history . It seems it was lost sight of about a century ago . There were copies but theoriginal was gone . I concluded at once that the map had somehow come into the hands of Alfred Brightwood . SinceI was convinced that this was the truth and since I had read the writing about the gold discoveredon the mysterious island charted there I decided that it would be wise to find out whetheror not it were possible that this strange story might be true . I found my answer in a boundvolume of Scottish Geographic Magazines in a series of articles entitled The So_Called MythicalIslands of the Atlantic . It seems that there is fairly good proof that a number of vessels landed on the North Americancontinent before Columbus did . Driven out of their course or lured on by hopes of gold andadventure these ships from time to time discovered and rediscovered lands to the west of Ireland_They thought of the land as islands and gave them names . The island of Brazil was one of them_If you were to consult this map I have here you would find the island of Brazil indicated bya circle which is nearly as large as Ireland yet if you were to cruise all over the watersin the vicinity of this supposed island you would find only the restless old ocean . What s the answer then _ he smiled . Just this . These ancient sea rovers didn t have any accurateway of telling where they were at a given time on the sea so they had to guess at it . Carriedon by winds and currents they often traveled much farther than they thought . They landed onthe continent of North America and thought it an island . When they came back to Europe theytried to locate the land they had discovered on a map and missed it by only a thousand milesor so . Our ancient friend who wrote of his experiences on the back of this map had doubtless beencarried to some point in Central or South America for there was even in those days plentyof gold to be found in those regions . So you see he turned to Vincent with a smile you went five hundred miles out to sea forthe purpose of rediscovering America . Not much chance of success . Anyway that s what I thought and that is why I dashed off on a wild race in the _Kittlewake_ . And that s why we re here . Silence followed the ending of Curlie s narrative . There seemed to be nothing more to say_So they sat there staring at the sea for a long time_The silence was at last broken by the skipper s announcement . Smoke on the larboard bow . It was true . Their relief was at hand_Almost immediately afterward Curlie received a second reassuring message from the captain ofthe liner . A short time after that he had the pleasure of escorting the dripping daughter ofa millionaire up the gangway_The next day as they were moving in toward the dock Vincent Ardmore approached Curlie . My sister there was a strange smile on his lips says you set out on this trip for thepurpose of having me arrested . I did . Well the other boy choked up and could not continue . The law punishment prisons and all that as I understand it said Curlie thoughtfully have but one purpose to teach people what other folks rights are and to encourage them inrespecting them . It s my business to see that there is fair play in the air . He paused and looked away at the sea . When he resumed there was a suspicious huskiness in hisvoice . Seems to me that as far as you are concerned nature has punished you about enough_You ought to know by this time what interfering with the radio wave lengths belonging to seatraffic might mean to shipwrecked men and _well _Oh what s the use _ he broke off abruptly . I m a chicken_hearted fool . You re out on parole and must report to your sister every week_She s _she s what I d call a brick . Turning hastily he walked away_Almost before he knew it he all but ran over Gladys Ardmore coming to meet him . Oh Mister _Mister she hesitated . Just plain Curlie he smiled . You _you re coming to see me when you get home . Won t you . Curlie thought a moment then of a sudden the spacious walls of the Ardmore mansion flashedinto his mind . To go there as an officer of the law was one thing to go as a guest was quiteanother . Why _why he drew back in confusion you ll have to excuse me but _but Oh . I know _ she exclaimed . It s the house and everything . Tell you what she seized himby the arm there s a little old_fashioned farmhouse down in one corner of our estate . Itwas there when we bought it and has been kept just the same ever since . Even the furniture red plush chairs kitchen stove and everything are there . We ll go down there and have a regularfrolic sometime popcorn molasses candy checkers and everything . We ve a wonderful cook whoonce lived on a farm . We ll take her along as a chaperon . Now will you come . Will you _ sheurged eagerly . Why _why If you don t she held up a warning finger I ll come up and visit you in that secret wirelessroom of yours just as I once said I would . In that case said Curlie I suppose I ll have to surrender . And he added happily herewe are back to dear old North America without any gold but with a lot to be thankful for . The boat was bumping against the dock . Giving his arm a squeeze the girl dashed away_CHAPTER XXVOFF ON ANOTHER WILD CHASEA few nights later Curlie was back in the secret tower room . He was busy as ever running downtrouble_Joe Marion entering the room noiselessly dropped a letter into his hand . The letter borethe insignia of the Ardmore family in one corner . From Gladys Ardmore _ he told himself_But he was mistaken . It was a typewritten letter signed in a bold business hand . It ran . It is with great pleasure that I inclose a check for the sum of the reward offered for the safe return of my son Signed J . Anson Ardmore . Curlie looked at the check then uttered a low whistle . Pay to the order of C . Carson 10 000_00 he whispered . Then out loud . Joe what would a fellow do with ten thousand dollars . Search me Joe grinned back . You got the fever or something _ he asked a second later_Curlie showed him the check . Why said Joe you might buy a car . Not much . The Humming Bird s quite good enough . Tell you what he said after a moment s thought just get that cashed for me will you . Then find out where our old skipper and the engineer live and send them a thousand apiece_After that pocket a thousand for yourself . Then _then _Oh well hire me a safety deposit boxand buy me a lot of Liberty bonds . Might want em some day . And say that reminds me he pointed to a square of vellum which hung on a stretcher inthe corner . Take that over to the big library on the North Side and tell em it s a presentfrom us . It s that map Vincent Ardmore gave me . It s worth a thousand dollars but such mapsare not safe outside a library . Tell em to put it on ice he laughed_Scarcely had Joe departed than a keen_eyed gray_haired man entered the tower room . He wasColonel Edward Marshall Curlie s superior . Curlie he wrinkled his brow as he took a seat there s somebody raising hob with the radioservice in Alaska . Curlie nodded his head . I thought there might be . Sends on 1200 doesn t he . He was thinkingof the hotel mystery and of the strange girl who had whispered to him so often out of the night . Yes how did you know so much . Part of my job . But you ve been away . Radiophone whispers travel far . Well said the colonel settling down to business Alaska s in a bad way . This fellow doesn tconfine himself to 1200 up there . He uses all sorts of wave lengths seems to take pleasurein mussing up important government communications and even more in breaking in on Munson . Munson the Arctic explorer . Yes . He s making a try for the Pole . Much depends upon his keeping in touch with the outsideworld and this crank or crook seems determined that he shall not . Why don t they catch him . Well you see he wrinkled his brow again the boys up there are rather new at it . Don tunderstand the radio compass very well . The fellow moves about and all that so it s difficult . I thought he said slowly after a moment that you might like to tackle the case . Would I _ exclaimed Curlie jumping to his feet . Try me . Can I take Joe along . As you like . Better get off pretty promptly say day after to_morrow . Never fear . We ll be off on time . The colonel bowed and left the room . Alaska . Alaska . Curlie murmured after a time Alaska and the Yukon trail for of courseit will be that . It s too late for the boats . And that reminds me I made a promise to GladysArdmore . Only one night left . A short time after that he put in an out_of_town telephone call . It was a girlish voice thatanswered_Late the next night Curlie made his way home along the well_remembered Forest Preserve road_He was riding in the Humming Bird . He had been to Gladys Ardmore s party for two and a chaperondown in the little farmhouse . The party had been a grand success and he was carrying away pleasantmemories which would serve him well on the long long Yukon trail and the weary and eventfulmiles which lay beyond its further terminal_If you wish to learn of Curlie s adventures up there and of the secret of the whisperer youmust read the next volume entitled On the Yukon Trail
