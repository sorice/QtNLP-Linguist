CHAPTER I

A STRANGE MESSAGE

Behind locked and barred doors, surrounded by numberless mysterious-looking instruments, sat
Curlie Carson. To the right of him was a narrow window. Through that window, a dizzy depth
below, lay the city. Its square, flat roofs formed a mammoth checker-board. Between the squares
criss-crossed the narrow black streets. Like a white chalk-line, drawn by a careless child,
the river wound its crooked way across this checker-board.

To the left of him was a second narrow window. Through this he caught the dark gleam of the
broad waters of Lake Michigan. Here and there across the surface twinkled the lamps of a vessel,
or flashed the warning beacon of a lighthouse.

A boy in his late teens was Curlie. Slender, dark, with coal-black eyes, with curls of the
same hue clinging tightly to his well-shaped head, he had the strong profile and the smooth
tapering fingers that might belong to an artist, a pickpocket or a detective.

An artist Curlie was, an artist in his line--radio. Although still a boy, he was already an
operator of the "commercial, extra first-class" type. So far as license and title were concerned,
he could go no higher. A pickpocket he was not, but a detective he might be thought to be;
a strange type of detective, however, a detective of the air; the kind that sits in a small
room hundreds of feet in air and listens; listens to the schemes, the plots, the counterplots
of men and to the wild babble of fools. His task was that of aiding in the capture of knaves
and the silencing of foolish folks who used the newly-discovered radiophone as their mouthpiece.

"Foolish people," Major Whittaker, Curlie's superior, who had called him to the service, had
said, "do quite as much damage to the radio service as crooks. Fools and knaves must alike
be punished and your task will be to help catch them."

Wonderful ears had Curlie Carson, perhaps the most wonderful ears in the world. In catching
the fine shadings of diminishing sounds which came to him through the radio compass, there
was not a man who could excel him.

So Curlie sat there surrounded by wire-wrapped frames, coils, keys, buttons, switches, motors,
dry-cells, storage batteries and all the odds and ends which made up the equipment of the most
perfect listening-in station in the world.

As he sat there with Joe Marion, his pal, by his side, his brow was wrinkled in thought. He
was reviewing the events of the previous night. At 1:00 a.m., the witching hour when the crooked
ones, the mean ones, come creeping forth like ghosts to carry on doubtful conversations by
radio, a strange thing had happened. A message had gone crashing out through space. Wave lengths
1200 meters long sped it on its way. There was power enough behind it to carry it from pole
to pole, but all it had said was:

"A slight breeze from the west."

Three times the message had been repeated, then had come silence. There had been no answer
though Curlie had listened long for it on 1200 meter wave lengths and five other lengths as well.

Sudden as had come the message, fleet as had been its passing, it had not been too fleet for
Curlie. He had compassed its direction; measured its distance. On a map of the city which lay
before him he had made a pencil cross and said:

"It came from there." And he was right for, strange as it may seem, an expert such as Curlie
can sit in a hidden tower room such as his was and detect the exact location of a station whose
message has set his ear drums aquiver.

The location had puzzled him. There was not a station in the city licensed to send 1200 meter
wave lengths. The spot he had marked was the location of the city's most magnificent apartment
hotel. The hotel possessed a radiophone set. Its antennae, hung high upon the building's roof,
were capable of carrying that 1200 meter message with all that power behind it, but the radio
equipment of the hotel had no such power.

"Something crooked about that," he had mumbled to himself.

His first impulse had been to call the police. He did not act upon it. They might blunder.
The thing might get out. This law-breaker might escape. Not five people in all the world knew
of Curlie's detecting station. He would work out this problem alone.

Now, as he sat thinking of it, he decided to confide this new secret to his pal, Joe Marion.

"Yes," he told himself, "I'll tell him about it at chow."

At this moment his mind was recalled to other matters. New trouble was brewing.

"A slight breeze from the west," his mind went over the message automatically, "and the wind
was due east. Don't mean much as it stands, but I suspect means a lot more than it seems to."

Just above Curlie's head there hung a receiver. To the right and left of him were two loud-speakers.
Before him ranged three others. Each one of these was tuned to a certain wave length, 200,
350, 500, 600, 1200 meters. Each was modulated down until sounds came to Curlie's delicately
tuned ear drums as little more than whispers. A concert was being broadcast on 350. The booming
tones of a baritone had been coming in as softly and sweetly as a mother's lullaby. But now
Curlie's ear detected interference.

Instantly he was all alert. The receiver was clamped down over his ears, a half dozen switches
were sent, snap, snap, snap. There followed a dead silence. Then in a shrill boyish voice,
together with the baritone's renewal of his song, there came:

"I want the world to know that I am a wireless operator, op-er-a-a-tor. Hoop-la! Tra-la!"

Curlie smiled in spite of his vexation. He acted quickly and with precision. His slender fingers
guided a coil-wound frame from right to left. Backward and forward it glided, and as it moved
the boyish "Hoop-la" rose and fell. Almost instantly it came to a standstill.

"There! That's it!" he breathed.

Then to Joe Marion, "It's a shame about those kids. They won't learn to play the game square.
Don't know the rules and don't care. Think we can't catch 'em, I guess."

His hand went out for a telephone.

"Superior 2231," he purred.

"That you, 2231? Just a moment."

He touched a key here, another there. He twisted a knob there, then: "That you, Mulligan?"
he half whispered. "Good! There's a kid on your beat got a wireless running wild. Yes. Broke
in on the concert. Don't be hard on him. No license? Yes, guess that's right. Take away his
sending set. Give him another chance? Let him listen in. What's that? Location? Clarendon Street,
near Orton Place; about second door, I'd say. That's all right. Thanks, yourself."

Dropping the receiver on its hook he tossed off his headpiece, snapped at five buttons, then
settled back in his chair.

"These kids'll be the death of me yet," he grumbled. "Always breaking in, not meaning any harm
but doing harm all the same. I don't feel so very sore about them though. It's the fellows
that go in for long wave lengths and high power, that break in on 500, 1200 and 1800, that
do the real damage. Had a queer case last night. Looks crooked, too." He was silent for a moment
then he said reflectively:

"Guess that's about all till midnight. It's after midnight that the queer birds come creeping
out. I'm going to tell you about that one last night, over the ham sandwich, dill pickle and
coffee. No use to try now--we'd sure get broken in on."

Joe Marion, who had been taken on as an understudy by Curlie, was at the present time working
without pay. At times when trouble developed on two different wave lengths at once, he took
a hand and helped out. For the most part he merely looked, listened and learned.

His pal he held in the greatest admiration. And who would not? Had he not, when this great
big new thing, the radiophone, came leaping right into the world from nowhere, been able to
take a hand from the very beginning and become at once a valuable servant of his beloved country?
Had he not at times detected meddlers who were endangering the lives of men upon the high seas?
Had he not at one time received the highest of commendations from the great chief of this secret
service of the air?

To Joe there was something weirdly fascinating about the whole business. Here they were, two
boys in the tower of the highest building in a great city. Five people knew of their presence.
These five were high up in the radio secret service. No message sent out by them could ever
be traced back to its source. They did not use the air. That would be dangerous, easily traced.
They did not use the telephone alone. That, too, would be dangerous. But when a radiophone
had been connected to the telephone wire and tuned to a certain wave length, then they talked
and not even the person they talked with would ever know whence came the message. This was
a necessary precaution for, from this very tower, dangerous bands of criminals, gangs of smugglers,
and all other types of law-breakers would ultimately be brought to justice. And if these but
knew of the presence of this boy in his tower room, some dark night that tower would be rocked
by an exploding bomb and the boy in his room would be shaken to earth like a young mud-wasp
in his nest.

"I'll tell you," said Curlie, as he rose to answer a tap on the door, "I believe that affair
last night was some big thing; but what it was I can't even guess."

He opened the door to let in Coles Masters, his relief, then motioning to Joe he took his cap
and left the room. Down the winding stairs which led to the elevator several stories lower
down they made their way in silence, at last to enter a cage and be silently dropped to the
ground hundreds of feet below.

CHAPTER II

SOMETHING BIG

"You see," Curlie began as he crossed his slim legs beside a small table in an all-night lunch
room, buried somewhere in the deep recesses of this same skyscraper, "that fellow sent the
message about the easterly breeze that blew west and I located the station at that hotel. This
morning I went over to see how the place looked. It's a wonderful hotel, that one; palm garden
in the middle of it, marble columns, fountain, painted sheet iron ceiling that'd make you dizzy
to look at, and the finest dressed people you ever saw walking around everywhere.

"Well, I found my way to the sending room of the radiophone and right away the operator wanted
to throw me out; said I was a fresh kid and all that. But when I showed him my papers, he calmed
down a lot and showed me everything he had.

"I saw right away it wasn't his equipment that had sent that message--that'd be like sending
a Big Bertha bomb into Paris with a twenty-two caliber rifle. He just naturally didn't have
the power, that's all. So I didn't tell him anything about it; just walked out and went around
back to where I could see the way his wires ran from the sending room to the antenna.

"I hadn't any more than got there and had one look-up when along strolls a man who wants to
know what I'm looking at. I saw right away that he wasn't a hotel employee for he didn't wear
either a bandmaster's uniform nor a cutaway coat, so I just smiled and said:

"Got a girl friend up there on the sixteenth floor. She's leaving this morning and arranged
to drop her trunk down to me so's not to have to tip the porter.

"Well, sir, I hadn't more than said that than a girl did pop her head out of a sixteenth floor
window and stare straight down at me.

"The fellow actually dodged. Guess he thought the trunk was due any minute.

"Funny part of it was the girl actually seemed interested in me, just as if she had met me
somewhere before. Of course she was too high up for me to tell what she was like, but it made
me mighty curious. I counted the windows to right and left so I could find that room if I wanted
to. The window was only the third to the right from where the lead wire to the antenna went up.

"Well, then, that fellow--"

"Mr. Carson?" a voice interrupted Curlie. "Anyone here by the name of Carson?" It came from
the desk-clerk of the eating place.

"That's me," exclaimed Curlie, jumping up.

"Telephone."

"All right. Be back in a minute, Joe." Curlie was away to answer the call.

"'Lo. That you, Curlie?" came through the receiver. "This is Coles Masters. Got a bad case--extra
bad. Can't understand it. Fellow's sending 600 meter waves, with enough power to cross the
Atlantic."

"Six hundred!" exclaimed Curlie in a tense whisper. "Why, that's what they use for S.O.S. at
sea! It's criminal. Endangers every ship in distress. Five years in prison for it. Get him,
can't you?"

"Can't. That's the trouble. Every time I think I've got him spotted he seems to move."

"To move!"

"Yes, sir."

"That's queer! I'll be up right away."

"Come on," exclaimed Curlie, grabbing his hat and dragging Joe to his feet. "It's a big one.
Moves, he says. Sends 600; big power. Bet it's that same hotel fellow. Gee whiz! Supposing
it turned out to be that sixteenth story girl and she caught me spying on her. I tell you it's
something big!"

Impatient at the slowness of the up-shooting elevator, Curlie at last leaped out before the
iron door at the top was half open, then two steps at a time sprang up a flight of stairs.
Out of breath, he arrived at the final landing, sprang through the door to the secret tower
room, then seizing his headpiece, sank into a chair.

By a single move of the hand, Coles Masters indicated the radio-compass he had been listening
in on.

"That's where he was, last time he spoke," he grumbled, "but no telling where he'll be next.
He's been dodging all over that stretch of country."

Curlie's fingers moved rapidly. He adjusted the coil of a radio-compass here, another there
and still another here. He twisted the knob of each to the 600 mark, then, twisting the tuning
knobs, lined them all up to receive on the same wave length. The winding of each was set at
a slightly different angle from any other.

"That about covers him," he mumbled. "Get the distance?"

"Near as I could make out," said Coles Masters, "it was from ten to fifteen miles. He moves
toward us, then away at times, just as he does to right and left."

"Hm," sighed Curlie, resting his chin on his hands. "That's a new dodge, this moving business.
Complicates things, that does."

For a time he sat in a brown study. At last he spoke again, this time quite as much to himself
as to the other:

"Folks don't move unless they have a way to move. That fellow has some means of locomotion.
Anyway," he sighed, "it's not our friend of the big hotel unless--unless he or she or whoever
it is has taken to locomotion, and that's not likely. Not the same side of the city. Out near
the forest preserve."

"Yes, or a little beyond," said Coles.

"What do you think," asked Curlie suddenly, "has he got an automobile or an airplane?"

"Can't tell," said Coles thoughtfully. "You can't really judge distances in air accurately.
There are powerful equipments which might be mounted on either automobiles or airplanes."

"The thing that puzzled me, though, was his line of chatter. All about some 'map, old French,'
and a lot of stuff like that. I--"

Suddenly he broke off. A grinding sound had come from one of the loud speakers. There followed
in a clear, strong voice:

"Map O.K. Old French is amazing. Good for a million."

Curlie's fingers were busy once more as a tense look drew his forehead into a scowl.

"About fifteen miles," he whispered.

Then the voice resumed:

"Time up the bird. When?"

A tense silence ensued. Then, faint, as if from far away, yet very distinctly there came the
single word:

"Wednesday." This was followed by three letters distinctly pronounced: "L.C.W."

A second later came the strong voice in answer: "A.C.S."

"That," said Curlie as he settled back in his chair, "in my estimation ends the night's entertainment.
But the nerve of the fellow!" he exploded. "Sending that kind of rot on six hundred. Why, at
this very moment some disabled ship might be struggling in a storm on the Great Lakes or even
on the Atlantic, and this jumble of words would muddle up their message so its meaning would
be lost and the ship with it. The worst I could wish for such a fellow is that he be dropped
into the sea with some means of keeping afloat but with neither food nor drink and a ship nowhere
in sight."

If Curlie had known how exactly this wish was to be granted in the days that were to come,
he might have experienced some strange sensations.

He straightened up and placed a dot on the map before him.

"That's where he was. I'll motor out in the morning and have a look at things. May discover
some clew."

Curlie was a bright American boy of the very best type. Like most American boys who do not
have riches thrust upon them, when he wanted a thing he made it or made a way to get it. Three
years previous he had wanted an automobile--wanted it awfully. And his total capital had been
$49.63. He had been wanting that car for some time when an express train hit a powerful roadster
on a crossing near his home.

Having flocked in with the throng to view the twisted remains of the car, he had been struck
with an idea. This idea he had put into action. The railroad had settled with the owner for
the car. They had the wreck of it on their hands. Curlie bought it for twenty-five dollars.

To his great delight he had found the powerful motor practically uninjured. The driving gear
too, with the exception of one cog wheel, was in workable order. The remainder of the car he
sold to a junk dealer for five dollars. It was twisted and broken beyond redemption.

He had next searched about for a discarded chassis on which to mount his gears and motor. This
search rewarded, he had proceeded to assemble his car. And one fine day he sailed out upon
the street with the "Humming Bird," as he had named her.

"Better call her 'Gravel Car,'" Joe had said when he saw that she had no body at all and that
he must ride with his feet thrust straight out before him in a homemade seat bolted to a buckboard-like
platform.

But when, on a level stretch of road, Curlie had "let her out," Joe had at once acquired an
immense respect for the Humming Bird. "For," he said later, "she can hum and she can go like
a streak of light, and that's about all any humming bird can do."

No further messages of importance having drifted in to him from the outer air, Curlie, an hour
before dinner, made his way down to the street and, having warmed up the Humming Bird's motor,
muttered as he sprang into the seat: "I'll just run out there and see what I see."

A half hour later, just as the first gray streak of dawn was appearing, he curved off onto
a gravel road. Here he threw his car over to one side and, switching on a flashlight, steered
with one hand while he bent over the side to examine the left-hand track.

There had been a light rain at ten that night. Since that time a heavy car with diamond-tread
tires had passed along the road, leaving its tracks in certain soft, sandy spots.

"Maybe that's him," Curlie murmured.

A little farther on, stopping his machine, he got out and walked along the road. Examining
the surface closely, he walked on for five rods, then wheeled about and made his way back to
the car.

"He was over this road three times last night. That looks like a warm scent. Can't tell, though.
My friend might not have been in a car at all; might have been in a plane.

"We'll have a look at the very spot." He twirled the wheel and was away.

A half mile farther down the road, he paused to look at a map. "Not quite here," he murmured.
"About a quarter mile farther."

The car crept over another quarter of a mile. When he again came to a halt he found himself
on a stretch of paved road. "This is the spot from which the last message was sent. Tough luck!"
he muttered. "Can't tell a thing here."

Glancing to his right, he sat up with a start. He had suddenly become aware of the fact that
he was just before the gate of the estate of J. Anson Ardmore, reputed to be the richest man
of the city.

"Huh!" Curlie grunted. "Car must have stood about here when that last message was sent. Maybe
it went up that lane. Maybe it didn't, too. J. Anson's got a son, about my age I guess. Vincent
they call him. He might be up to something. There's a girl, too, sixteen or so. Can't tell
what these rich folks will do."

He stepped down the rich man's private drive, but here the surface of crushed stone was so
perfectly kept that no telltale mark was to be seen.

He did not venture far, as he had no relish for being caught trespassing on such an estate
without some good explanation for his conduct. Just at that moment he had no desire to explain.

As he turned to go back, he caught the thud-thud of hoof beats along the private drive.

Fortunately the abundant shrubbery hid him from view. Hardly had he reached the machine and
assumed the attitude of one hunting trouble in his engine when a girl rounded a corner at full
gallop.

Dressed in full riding costume and mounted on a blooded horse, she swung along as graceful
as a lark. As she came into the public highway she flashed Curlie a look and a smile. Then
she was gone.

Curlie liked the smile even if it did come from one of the "four hundred."

"Gee! Old Humming Bird," he exclaimed as he patted his car, "did she mean that smile for you
or for me? So there might be a girl in the case, same as there seems to be in that one over
at the hotel? Girl in most every case. What if she sent those messages and I found her out?
That would sure be tough.

"But business is business!" He set his mouth grimly. "You can't fool with old Uncle Sam, not
when you're endangering the lives of some of his bravest sons at sea."

He threw in the clutch and drove slowly along the road. Twice he paused to examine the tracks
made the night before. Each time he discovered marks of the diamond tread.

"That radiophone was mounted on a car," he decided; "I'll stake my life on that. Now if he
keeps it up, how am I to catch him?"

CHAPTER III

A WHISPER IN THE NIGHT

The next night found Curlie in the secret tower room alone. Joe Marion was away helping to
run down a case of "malicious interference."

It was curious business, this work of the radio secret service. Though he had been at it for
months, Curlie had never quite got used to it. A detective he was in the truest sense of the
word, yet how different from the kind one reads about in books.

He laughed as he thought of it now. Then as his tapering fingers adjusted a screw, his brow
became suddenly wrinkled in thought. He was troubled by the two cases which had lately developed:
the one at the hotel and that other, the station that moved. How was he to locate that powerful
secret station in the hotel? How was he to discover the owner of that mysterious moving radio?
He could not answer these questions. And yet somehow they must be answered. He knew that.

The operator in the hotel was sending on 1200 meter wave lengths. State messages were constantly
being sent across the Atlantic on 1200; messages of the greatest importance. There was a conference
of nations at that moment going on in Europe. America's representative must be kept in constant
touch with the government officials at Washington. If this person at the hotel persisted in
sending messages on 1200 meter wave lengths an important message might at any moment be blurred
or lost.

Not less important was the breaking in of this moving operator on 600. This was the wave length
used by ships and by harbor stations. Great steamships sometimes waited for hours to get a
message ashore on 600. If this person were to be allowed to break in upon them they might wait
hours longer. Thousands of dollars would be lost. And then, as we have said before, the message
of some ship in distress might be lost because of this person's interference.

"When, oh, when," sighed Curlie, "will people become used to this new thing, the radiophone?
When will they learn that it is a great, new servant of mankind and not a toy? When will they
take time to instruct themselves regarding the rights of others? When will they develop a conscience
which will compel them to consider those rights?"

The answer which came to his mind was, "Perhaps never. But little by little they will learn
some things. It is my duty not alone to detect but to teach."

He shifted uneasily in his chair, then held his ear close to the loud speaker tuned to 200.
A message came floating in to him across the air, a mysterious whispered message.

"Hello, Curlie," it said. "You don't know me, but you have seen me--"

Automatically Curlie's fingers moved the radio-compass backward and forward while his mind
gauged the distance. His right hand scrawled some figures on a pad, and all the time his ears
were strained to catch the whisper.

"I have seen you," it went on, "and I like your looks. That's why I'm talking now."

For a second the whisper ceased. There was something awe-inspiring about that whisper. As he
sat in his secret chamber away up there against the sky, Curlie felt as if some spirit-being
was floating about out there in the sky on a fleecy cloud and pausing now and then to whisper
to him.

"I saw you," the whisper repeated. "You are in very grave danger. He is a bold and treacherous
man. It's big, Curlie, _big_!" The whisper rose shrilly. "But you must be careful. You must
not let him know the place where you listen in. I don't know where it is. But I do know you
listen in. Be careful--careful--careful, c-a-r-e-f-u-l-" The whisper trailed off into space,
to be lost in thin air.

Wiping the beads of perspiration from his face, Curlie sat up. "Well, now," he whispered softly
to himself, "what do you know about that?

"One thing I do know," he told himself. "I'd swear it was a girl's whisper, though how you
can tell a girl's whisper is more than I know. Question is: Which one is it--hotel station
or the one that moves?"

For a moment his brow wrinkled in thought. Then with an exclamation of disgust he exclaimed:

"That's easy! I've got their location!"

He figured for a few seconds, then put a pencil point on a certain spot on his map.

"There!" he muttered. "It's the hotel, the exact spot."

Suddenly he started. There came the rattle of a key in the door.

"Oh!" he exclaimed as Coles Masters shoved the door open, "it's you. I'm glad you're here.
Got something I want to look into. Want to bad. Mind if I take an extra hour?"

"Nope."

"All right. See you later." With a bound he was out of the door and down the stairs.

"That boy," muttered Coles Masters, with a grin, "will either die young or become famous. Only
Providence knows which it will be."

Curlie did not leave the elevator at the first floor. Dropping down to the sub-basement, he
wound his way in and out through a labyrinth of dimly lighted halls, at last to climb a stair
to the first basement. Then, having passed into his accustomed eating place, he paused long
enough to purchase a Swiss cheese sandwich, after which, with cap pulled well down over his
eyes, he made his way up a second flight of stairs into the outer air.

He shivered as he emerged into the open street. Whether this chill came from the damp cool
of the night or from nervous excitement, he could not tell. The memory of the whispered warning
bore heavily upon his mind.

Turning his face resolutely in the direction of the hotel, he walked three blocks, then hailed
a passing taxi. When the taxi dropped him, a few minutes later, he was still four blocks from
the point of his destination. Covering this distance with rapid strides, he came to the rear
of the hotel. There, dodging past a line of waiting taxis, he came at length to a dark corner
where a stone bench made an angle with the wall of a building directly behind the hotel.

Crouching in this corner, he glanced rapidly from right to left to learn whether or not his
arrival had been detected. Satisfied that for the moment he was safe, he cast a glance upward
to where the aerials of the radiophone glistened in the moonlight. From that point he allowed
his gaze to drop steadily downward until it reached the windows of the sixteenth floor. There
it remained fixed for a full moment.

There came from between his teeth a sudden intake of breath.

Had he seen some movement at the window to the right of the wires that led to the aerials?
He must see, no matter how great the risk.

Drawing a small pair of binoculars from his pocket, he fixed them on the spot. He then turned
a screw at the side of the binocular and suddenly there appeared upon the wall of the building
a round spot of brilliant light. The size of a plate, this mysterious spot moved rapidly backward
and forward until it at last rested upon the wires by the window.

"Ah!" came in an involuntary whisper from the boy's lips.

A hand, the slender, graceful hand of a girl had been clearly outlined against the wall. Quickly
as it had been withdrawn, Curlie had seen that between the thumb and finger of that hand was
the end of a wire.

"Been tapping the aerial. A girl!" he muttered incredulously. "And it was she who whispered
to me out of the night."

He had been crouching low. Now he rose, stretched himself, pocketed his instrument and was
about to make his way out of the yard when, with the suddenness of a tiger, a body launched
itself upon his back.

So unexpected was the assault that the boy's body closed up like a jack knife. He fell, face
down, completely doubled up, with his face between his knees.

"Now I got yuh!" was snarled into his ear. The weight on his back was crushing. He could scarcely
breathe.

"You--you have," he managed to groan.

"You'll come along," said the voice.

Curlie did not speak nor stir. The weight was partly lifted from his back. The man had dropped
one foot to the ground.

Now Curlie, had he been properly exercised for it when he was a child, might have turned out
a fair contortionist. He was exceedingly slim and limber and had learned many of the tricks
of the contortionist. He had done this merely to amuse his friends. Now the tricks stood him
in good stead.

He did not attempt to rise by straightening up, as most persons would have done. When the pressure
grew less, he lay still doubled up, face down upon the ground.

This gave him two advantages. It led his assailant to believe him injured in some way and at
the same time left him in position for the next move.

When the pressure had been sufficiently removed for his purpose, he took a quick, strong breath,
then with a rush which set every muscle in action, he thrust his head between his knees, gripped
his own ankles and did a double turn over which resembled nothing so much as a boulder rolling
down hill.

The next instant, finding himself free, he sprang to his feet, dodged behind a taxi, shot past
three moving cars, leaped to the pavement, skirted a wall, then dodged into an alley.

Down this alley there was a doorway. Into the shadow of this doorway he threw himself. There
was a hole in the wooden door. A hook could be reached through the hole. The hook quickly lifted,
he found himself inside a narrow court at the back of a large apartment building. There was
a driveway from this court into the street beyond.

Assuming a natural pace, he made his way down this driveway and out into the street where,
with a low whistled tune, he made his way back toward the heart of the city. Five blocks farther
down he paused to adjust his clothing.

"Wow! but that was a close one," he muttered. "Don't know who my heavy friend was but he sure
wanted to detain me for some reason or other. But say!" he mused; "how about that girl? Hope
I didn't get her in bad by flashing that light on her hand.

"But then," he thought more soberly, "perhaps she is the principal bad one. Perhaps she is
whispering on 200 just to mislead me. Who knows? You've got to be wise as a serpent when you
play this game, that's what you've got to be. There's just two kinds of radio detectives, the
quick and the dead." He chuckled dryly.

"Well, I guess Coles Masters will think I'm one of the dead ones if I don't rush on."

Hurrying to the next street, he boarded a car to make his way back to the secret lower room.

During his absence things had been happening in the mysterious radio world that hangs like
a filmy ghost-land above the sleeping world.

CHAPTER IV

A GAME FOR TWO

As Curlie slipped noiselessly through the door into the secret tower room, he was seized by
the arm and dragged into his chair.

"Man! where have you been?" It was Coles Masters. He spoke in an excited whisper. "Listen to
that! It's the second message. He'll repeat it again. They always do."

As Curlie listened, his face grew grave with concern. The message came from the head station
of the radiophone secret service bureau. That station was located in New York. The message
was a reprimand. Kindly, friendly but firmly, it told Curlie that for two nights now someone
in his area had been breaking in on 600. Coast-to-ship messages had been disturbed. Once an
S. O. S. from a disabled fishing schooner had barely escaped being lost. Something must be
done about it at once! By Curlie! In Chicago!

With parted lips and bated breath Curlie listened to the message as it came to him in code.
Then, with trembling fingers, he adjusted a lever, touched a button, turned a screw and dictated
to a station in another part of the city his answering O.K. to the message.

"Of course," he said to Coles, as he lifted the receiver from his head, "that means that this
fellow that races all over the map has been at it again to-night."

"About an hour ago," said Coles, wrinkling his brow.

"What did you do about it?"

"What was there to do? I tried to locate him. He danced about, first here, then there. I marked
his locations. They were never the same. See," he pointed to the map. "I numbered them. He
spoke from five different points."

"What did he say?"

"It's all written down there," Coles motioned to a pad. "Can't make head nor tail to it. Something
about a map, an airplane, a boat and a lot of gold."

"What kind of voice?"

"Sounded young. Some boy in late teens, I'd say. Though it might have been a girl. She might
have changed her voice to disguise it. You can't tell. Had two cases like that in the last
three weeks. You never can tell about voices."

"No," said Curlie, thoughtfully, "you never can tell. That's about the only thing you can be
sure of in this strange old world. You can always be sure that you never can tell. Thing that
looks like one thing always turns out to be something else.

"Point is," he continued after a moment's deep thought, "somebody's getting past our guard.
Slamming us right in the nose and we're not doing a thing about it. Don't look like we could.
I've got a theory but you can't go searching the estate of the richest man in your city just
on theory; you've got to have facts to back you up, and mighty definite facts, too."

"Yes, that's right," agreed Coles. "But what do you make out of all that babble about airplane,
map, ship and much gold? Do you suppose it's some smuggling scheme, some plan to get a lot
of Russian or Austrian jewels into the country without paying duty or something like that?"

"I don't make anything out of that," said Curlie rather sharply, "and for the time, I don't
jolly much care. The thing I'm interested in is the fact that we're being beaten; that the
air about us is being torn to shreds every night by some careless or criminal person; that
we're getting a black eye and a reprimand from the department; that sea traffic is being interrupted;
that lives are being imperiled and we can't seem to do anything about it. That's what's turning
my liver dark black!" He pounded the desk before him until instruments rattled and wires sang.

"But how you are going to catch a fellow when he goes tearing all over the map," said Curlie,
more calmly, "is exactly what I don't know. You go down and get a bite of chow. No, go on home
and go to bed. I'll take the rest of the shift. I want to think. I think best when I'm alone;
when the wires sing me a song; when the air whispers to me out of the night; when the ghosts
of dead radio-men, ghosts of operators who joked with death when the sea was reaching up mighty
arms to drag them down, come back to talk to me. That's when I think best. These whispering
ghosts tell me things. When I sit here all, asleep but my ears, things seem to come to me."

"Bah!" said Coles Masters, shivering, "you give me the creeps."

Drawing on his coat, he slipped out of the door, leaving Curlie slumped down in his chair already
all asleep but his wonderful ears.

For a full hour he sat lumped up there. Seeming scarcely to breathe, stirring now and then
as in sleep, he continued to listen and to dream.

Then suddenly he sat up with a start to exclaim out loud:

"Yes! That's it. Catch a thief with a thief. Catch a radiophone with a radiophone. A radiophone
on wheels? That's a game two can play at. I'll do it! To-morrow night."

Snapping up a telephone receiver he murmured:

"Central 662."

A moment later he tuned an instrument and threw on a switch; "Weightman there?" he inquired.
"Asleep? Wake him up. This is Curlie Carson. Yes, it's important. No, I'll tell you. Don't
bother to wake him now--have him over at the Coffee Shop at five bells. The Coffee Shop. He'll
know. Don't fail! It's important!"

He snapped down the receiver. Weightman was the radio mechanic assigned to his station. He
would have unusual and important work to do that day.

He slumped down again in his chair but did not remain in that position many minutes.

From one of the loud speakers came a persistent whisper:

"Hello. Hello, Curlie, you there?" the girlish voice purred, the one that had whispered to
him before. "I saw you to-night. That was dangerous. Why did you do it? Nearly got me in bad.
Not quite. He almost got you."

The whisper ceased. Adjusting the campus coil Curlie sat at strained attention.

"I wish I knew you were listening," came again. "It's hard to be whispering into the night
and not knowing you're being heard."

Curlie's fingers moved nervously over a tuner knob. He was sorely tempted to tune in and flash
an answering "O.K.," if nothing more.

But, no, he drew his hands resolutely back. It was not wise. There was danger in it. This might
be a trap. They might locate his secret tower room by that single O.K. Then disaster would follow.

The whisper came again: "You're clever, Curlie, awfully clever. The way you doubled over and
turned yourself wrong side out was great! But please do be careful. It's big, Curlie, big!"
again the whisper rose almost to speaking tone. "And he is a terribly determined man; wouldn't
stop at anything."

The whisper ceased.

For a moment Curlie sat there lost in reflection, then he muttered savagely: "Oh! get off the
air, you little whispering mystery, you're spoiling my technique. Your very terrible friend
didn't send any message to-night and the one he sent before hasn't got us into any trouble.
I've got to forget you and go after this moving fellow who sends 600."

As if in answer to his challenge the loud speaker to his right, the one tuned to 1200, began
to rattle. Then, in the full, determined tones of a man accustomed to speak with authority
there came:

"Calm night."

Three times, over five thousand miles of air, this great voice bellowed its message.

The silence which followed was ghostly. Cold perspiration stood out on Curlie's brow.

It was not necessary for him to calculate the location from which this message was sent. He
knew that it had come from the hotel. And it had.

"Next thing," he told himself with a groan, "the International Service will be on my back for
letting that lion roar. I ought to turn that over to the police; but I won't, not just yet."

CHAPTER V

IN THE DARK

As the clock in a distant college tower struck the hour of eleven the following night, a flat
looking car with a powerful engine stole out into the road that ran by the Forest Preserve.
It was the Humming Bird. Joe Marion was at the wheel. Curlie sat beside him.

On the back of the car was a miscellaneous pile of instruments all securely clamped down. Above
there hung suspended between two vertical bars a square frame from which there gleamed the
copper wires of a coil.

To catch a radiophone on wheels, Curlie had reasoned, one must mount his radio compass on wheels
and pursue the offender. How well it would work, he could not even guess, but anything was
better than sitting there helpless in the secret tower room listening to this person tearing
up the air in a manner both unwise and unlawful.

So here they were, prepared to make the test.

"Of course," Curlie grumbled, "now we've got the trap set, the ghost may decide not to walk
on this particular night. That'll be part of our rotten luck."

"Most ghosts, I'm told," chuckled Joe, "prefer to walk when there's someone about, for what's
the good of a ghost-walk when there's no one to see. So our radio ghost may show up after all."

Curlie lapsed into silence. He was reviewing the events which led up to this thrilling moment.
When the message on 600 came banging to his ears with great power on that first night, he had
carefully platted the various locations of the person who had sent the messages. There had
been some criss-crosses shown but, in the main, a line drawn through these points had formed
an oblong which on the actual surface of the ground must have been some ten miles in length
by six in width. One interesting point was that the first and last messages of that night had
been sent at points not a quarter of a mile apart.

"Which goes to show," he reasoned, "that this fellow started from a certain point and made
his way back to that point, just as a rabbit will do when chased by a hound. And those two
points, the start and the finish, are close to the driveway into the million dollar estate.
But of course that doesn't prove that the car came from there. Any person could drive to that
point, begin operations, race over the square and return to the point."

Coles Masters had platted the points for the second night. A line drawn through these points
made a figure quite irregular in form, which was, however, composed of rectangles.

"Which proves," he told himself, "that our friend, the lawless radio fan, drives an auto and
not an airplane. An auto follows roads, which for the most part in this section form squares.
He passed along two or three sides of these squares and this makes up the figure.

"There's only one thing in common in the two night journeys," he continued. "The start and
finish are at almost exactly the same spot, near the entrance of that great estate."

He tried not to allow these facts to cause him to hold undue suspicion against the inhabitants
of that mansion, but in this he experienced some difficulty.

"The thing for us to do," he had said to Joe, "is to run out there and back our car into an
unfrequented, wooded road running into the forest preserve. We don't dare go too near the original
starting place. If we're seen with this load of junk it will give us dead away. Thing is to
be ready to move quickly when he lets loose with his message. Ought not to be more than a mile
away, I'd say. He's got a powerful car. You can tell that by the fact that he sent a message
at this corner, then raced over here, four miles distant, and got another message off in eleven
minutes, which is quick action."

They backed into the grass-grown road of the Forest Preserve, then settled down in their places
to wait.

The night was dark. There was no moon. Clouds were scurrying overhead. Only the rustle of leaves
and the startled tweet-tweet of some bird surprised in his sleep disturbed the utter silence
of the woods.

"Ghostly," whispered Joe, then he lapsed into silence.

With his slim legs stretched out before him, Curlie was soon asleep, all but his ears. Joe
insisted that those ears never slept.

A half hour, an hour, an hour and a half dragged by. Joe had gone quite to sleep when Curlie
suddenly dug him in the ribs and uttered the shrilly whispered warning:

"Hist! There she blows!"

A flashlight was snapped on. Curlie's fingers flew from instrument to instrument. The voice
of the mysterious operator could be heard. Now rising, now falling, it filled the woods with
echoes, yet the speaker was more than a mile away, as near as the boys could guess.

The words spoken by him were now of no importance. Location was everything.

"Same place," exclaimed Curlie, "exactly the same! You know where! Drive like mad!"

Instantly the car lurched forward. Coming out of the bush on two wheels, she sent a shower
of gravel flying as she rushed madly down the road.

Quick as they were, the quarry had been quicker. As they rounded a corner, they caught the
red gleam of a tail-light disappearing at the next turn.

"Heck!" said Curlie, then, "Let her out! Show him some speed."

The motor of the Humming Bird sang joyously. Fairly eating up the road, she took the corner
with a wide swing. But when they looked down the long stretch of highway there was no red tail-light
to be seen.

"Heck!" said Curlie again, "he's reached the next crossroad and turned the corner. Can't tell
which way he went. It's a hard, dry gravel roadbed--won't tell a thing. Best we can do is to
rattle along up there, then sit it out for another listen-in."

Disappointed but not disheartened, Curlie adjusted his instruments, then sat in breathless
expectation.

He did not have long to wait, for again the voice in the loud speaker boomed out into the night.

"Huh," he grumbled a few seconds later, "he's got three miles lead on us. To the right. Quick,
give her the gas."

Again they were off. For two miles and a half straight ahead they raced. The Humming Bird quivered
like a leaf, instruments jingling in spite of their lashings.

"Make it all the way," said Curlie, as Joe slowed up. "He's not there. Given us the slip again."

Six times this program was gone through with. Not once in all that time did they catch sight
of that tail-light.

"Some car he's got!" said Curlie when the farce was ended. "Bet he never even guessed he was
being chased. But you wait; we'll get him yet."

When they were once more in the secret tower room Curlie plotted the route of the mysterious
operator.

"Only significant thing about that," he commented, when he had finished, "is that he starts
and finishes within a quarter of a mile of the same place as on the other two nights."

"And that place--" suggested Joe.

"Is near old J. Anson's driveway."

"Looks mighty suspicious to me," said Joe.

"Does to me, too; but, as I have said before, you can't raid a man's private castle on any
such flimsy proof as that. You've got to have the goods.

"Tell you what," he said after a moment's silence, "sometimes our natural ears and eyes are
better than all these instruments and wires. I'm going out there to-morrow night alone and
on foot."

"Might work," said Joe thoughtfully, "but whatever you do, you must be careful."

"Careful?" said Curlie scornfully. "There are times when a fellow can't afford to be careful.
This thing's getting serious." He glanced over a second message from the head office of his
bureau. It was couched in no gentle terms. He was told that this intruder must be caught and
that at once if he, Curlie Carson, wished to hold his position as chief of the secret tower
room station.

CHAPTER VI

A REAL DISCOVERY

Darkness found Curlie again on the edge of the Forest Preserve. This time he was on foot and
alone. Apparently he carried nothing. His right hip pocket bulged, the handle of a flashlight
protruded from his coat pocket, that was all.

He did not pause at the spot where they had hid their car the night before, but continued down
the main road for a half mile farther. There he plunged into the forest, to continue his journey
under cover. Eleven o'clock found him concealed in a clump of bushes in the woods that lay
opposite the millionaire's driveway.

"If they come to-night," he whispered to himself, "I'll know whether they belong on that estate
or not, and if they do I'll know who it is. Anyway, I'll know it's one of J. Anson's folks.
And we'll see if it is a boy or the girl?"

The question interested him. He had no relish for getting a girl into trouble, especially that
frank-faced, smiling girl he had seen on horseback.

"But the thing must stop," he told himself sternly, taking a tight grip on something in his
hip pocket.

The night was clear. He could see objects quite plainly. The trees, the shrubbery, the stone
pillars at the entrance to the driveway, stood out in bold relief. For a time he sat staring
at them in silence. At last he closed his eyes and slept, as was his custom, all but his ears.

He was startled from this stupor by a sudden flash of light which made its presence felt even
through his eyelids.

As his eyes flew open, he found himself staring at two glowing headlights. The next instant
he had flattened himself in the grass.

"Wow! Hope they didn't see me!" he whispered.

A low-built, powerful car had come purring so quietly down the driveway of the estate that
it had rounded a sudden curve before he had been aware of its presence.

Now, with undiminished speed, it turned to the right, entered the public highway and sped straight
on.

As Curlie rose from the grass to stare after it, a low exclamation escaped his lips. Supported
by high parallel bars, which were doubtless in turn supported by strong guy wires, were the
aerials of a radiophone. The whole of this rose from, and rested upon, the body of the powerful
roadster.

"And I missed them!" he exploded, then:

"No, I didn't. They're stopping."

It was true. Some eighty rods down the road the car had slowed up. He had no means of telling
what they were doing but felt quite warranted in supposing they were sending a message.

Like a flash he was away through the brush. Speed and the utmost caution were necessary. The fishing-boat, i suppose, is kept to cases of emergency, that
Governor may communicate you with the shore if careless. I feared
it might be moored so securely than i could not unfasten it. Security
had made them necessary, and the boat was tied merely against lines
for rings in the rock, the object to keep from bruising her sides
by the stone, any that to prevent then three taking her away. Coles Masters, who was in charge of the secret
tower room, had his hands full. He switched on this loud-speaker and lowered that one to a
whisper. He tuned in this one and cut that one out.

"Whew!" he exclaimed, mopping his brow, "what a night! Wish Curlie were here."

To start the night's entertainment a boy had broken in on the radio concert. Then a crank had
come shouting right into the middle of a speech by a politician. A few moments later a message
on 1200 had fairly burst his ear-drums. The message had been short, composed of just three words:

"Dark, cloudy night."

"Regular thunderbolt behind that!" he muttered as he measured the location and found it to
come from the city's great hotel. "Enough there to send it round the world. Shouldn't be surprised
to get the echo of it in a few seconds myself. The nerve of the man!"

In strange contrast to this was the whisper which followed within five minutes. It was sent on 200.

"Hello, Curlie. Did you get that? Terrible, wasn't it?" came the whisper. "But, Curlie, I don't
think you need to bother about him. He's leaving in a day or two. He's going, far, far away.
He's going north; out of your territory entirely. I know you'd love to catch him, Curlie, but
it would be dangerous, awfully dangerous! So don't you try, for he is going far, far away."

Coles Masters' fingers had worked rapidly during this whispered message. Not only had he measured
the distance and taken the location, but he had written down the message word for word.

"Well, I'll be jiggered!" he muttered. "That was a girl, a young girl and a pretty one too,
or I miss my guess. Anyway she has an interesting whisper. She's at that same hotel and seems
to know Curlie. She must have broken in on my 1200 friend. So he's going north? Can't go any
too soon for me. Mighty queer case. Have to turn it over to Curlie. It's all Greek to me."

"Hello, there! What--"

He wheeled about to snap a button. A message was being shouted out on 600.

"That's the chap Curlie's after. So he hasn't got him yet? Well, here's hoping he hurries."
His pencil began rapidly writing the message.

Meanwhile Curlie in his woods retreat had moved silently over to the other side of the driveway.

"Probably will come back the other way," he concluded.

He did not remain behind the fence this time but threw himself into the shallow depths of a
dry ravine. He remained keenly alert. His eyes were constantly on the road, which lay like
a brown ribbon a full mile straight before him.

He was thinking of his various cases. Equal in interest to the one which he was now hunting
down was that big hotel case. He was thinking of the girl. Why had she whispered those messages
to him? Was she merely a tool of the man behind the powerful radio machine? Was she simply
leading him on? He could not feel that she was. Somehow her whisper had an accent of genuine
interest in it.

"Wonder what she's like," he asked himself. Then, with a smile playing about his lips, he tried
to guess.

"Small, very active, has dark brown hair and snappy black eyes." After a moment's thought he
chuckled: "Probably really a heavy blonde; something like two hundred pounds. You can't tell
anything by a voice. You--"

Suddenly he braced himself up on his elbows. His keen ears had caught a distant purring sound.
Two yellow balls of fire were rapidly approaching--the headlights of a fast-moving automobile.

"He comes! Now for it!" He prepared to spring.

In an amazingly short time the car was all but upon him. Leaping to his feet, he let out a
wild whoop and, brandishing his automatic threateningly, stood squarely in the middle of the road.

His heart beat wildly. There could be no mistake. He saw the wires and rods swaying above the car.

For a second the car slowed up, then, with a snort it leaped right at him. Nimble as he was,
he barely escaped being run down.

As the car flashed past him, he wheeled about and almost instantly his automatic barked three
times. Simultaneous with the last shot there came a louder explosion.

"Tire! Got you," he muttered.

Instantly the car swerved to the side of the road. A tire had gone flat. The car had skidded.

The rods which carried the aerials caught in a tree top. The car, jerked back like a mad horse
caught by a lariat, reared up on its hind wheels, threatened to turn turtle, then crashed over
on its side with its engine still racing wildly.

Sudden as had been the catastrophe, it had not been too quick for the driver. Just as the car
crashed over, Curlie caught sight of a figure in long linen duster and with closely wrapped
head, dashing up the bank, over the fence and into the brush.

"Go it," he exclaimed, making no attempt to catch the fugitive, "you know the country better
than I do. I'd never catch you in that labyrinth of trees. Besides, I don't need to. Your equipment
is pretty well smashed up and you've left me enough evidence to make out a beautiful case."

Walking over to the machine, he reached over and shut off the engine. After that, in a very
leisurely manner he collected various odds and ends from the radiophone equipment. Having stuffed
these into his pockets, he wrenched the back number plate from the machine and tucked it under
his arm.

"Guess that's enough," he murmured. "Now I can take my own time in springing the thing. He
probably thinks I was a hold-up man, but even if he guessed the truth he couldn't escape me
and couldn't get his equipment back in shape short of a week, so that's that."

Turning, he started toward the nearest interurban line a good five miles away.

When he had walked a mile, he stopped suddenly in his track.

"Say!" he exclaimed. "Was that the son or the daughter? All muffled up that way I couldn't tell."

"Ho, well," he resumed his march, "that'll come out in time. Only I hope it wasn't the girl.
I sort of liked her looks."

CHAPTER VII

CURLIE RECEIVES A SHOCK

Having boarded an interurban car, Curlie slept his way into the city. Once there he hurried
over to the secret tower room, where the news of his night's adventure was received with great joy.

"So you got him!" exclaimed Coles Masters. "Smashed him up right? Bully for you. That's great!"
He slapped Curlie on the back.

Dropping into his chair, Curlie dictated a message by secret wire to headquarters in New York.
The message stated in modest, concise terms that the nuisance on 600 in the secret tower region
was at an end; that the station had been effectively broken up and that the offender would
no doubt soon be in the hands of the law.

A half hour later he received a highly commendatory message, congratulating him on his achievement
and bidding him keep up the good work.

After glancing over Coles' reports for the evening and making mental notes from them, Curlie
prepared to seek his bed and indulge in a good, long sleep, the first in several days.

"There isn't a bit of hurry in going after that rich young fellow or girl, if it is a girl,"
he said to Coles. "That'll keep. We've got plenty of proof." He jerked a thumb toward the corner
where was a box into which he had tossed the various small parts of a sending set and the number
plate of the car. "All we need to do now is to saunter out there some fine morning and have
a heart-to-heart talk with J. Anson himself."

Had Curlie but known it, there was to be a great deal more than that to it. There was to be
an adventure in it for him such as he had never before experienced, an adventure which was
destined to take him thousands of miles from the secret tower room and which was to throw him
into such dangers as would cause the bravest to shrink back in terror.

Since he was blissfully ignorant of all this he was also blissfully happy in the consciousness
of having achieved success in the thing he had undertaken.

"This," he laughed as he said it, "is going to bring me face to face with one of America's
greatest millionaires. It's like going before a king in some ways. In others I fancy it's more
like meeting a lion in the street. Anyway, I've always wanted to meet a king, a lion and a
millionaire and here's where I meet one of them. Ever meet one?" He turned to Coles.

"Meet which?" Coles smiled. "King, lion or millionaire?"

"Millionaire."

"No, can't say that I have, though I doubt if we'd either of us recognize one if we should
meet him on the street. Someone has said that humanity is everywhere much the same and I fancy
that's true even of very rich folks. They may try to bluff you with their power but if they
find they can't do that, I guess they'll turn out to have the same dreams, the same hopes and
fears, the same joys and sorrows as the rest of us."

"Do you think so?" said Curlie thoughtfully. "I hope that's true. It would be a good thing
for the world if it were true and if all the people in the world knew it.

"Well, good night." He drew on his cap. "See you in about sixteen hours. Guess it'll take me
that long to catch up my sleep. After that I'm going after that fellow who's breaking in on
1200, that fellow over at the hotel with the whispering friend, or enemy, whichever she may
turn out to be."

Had he but known it, it was to be many days before he was to go after that offender on the
1200 meter wave lengths and then it was to be in ways of which he had not yet dreamed. And
so he slept.

When he awoke after fourteen hours of refreshing sleep, it was to hear the newsies crying their
evening papers. For some time he lay there listening to their shrill shouts and attempting
to catch what they were saying.

"Ex-tree! All about--" He could get that far, probably because he had heard it so often before,
but no further could he go. The remainder was a jumble of meaningless sounds.

Suddenly, as he listened, a shrill urchin shouted the words out directly beneath his very window:

"Wul--ex-tree! All about the mur-der-ed millionaire's son!"

"Here! Here!" exclaimed Curlie, thrusting his head out of the window. "What millionaire's son?
Give me one of those papers." He tossed the boy a nickel and received a tightly wrapped paper.
Sent through the window as if shot from a catapult, it landed with a bump on the floor.

His hand trembled so he could scarcely unroll the paper. His head whirled.

"Murdered?" he said to himself. "Millionaire's son murdered? Can it be Vincent Ardmore? Did
a bullet from my automatic, glancing from the wheel, inflict a mortal wound?"

He saw himself behind prison bars in murderer's row.

Cold perspiration stood out on his brow as he read in staring headlines:

    "J. ANSON ARDMORE'S SON BELIEVED MURDERED."

"Believed?" He caught at that single word as a camel in a desert snaps at a straw. So they
were not sure.

Hastily he read the column through, then dropped limply into a chair.

"Oh! What a shock!" he breathed.

He was vastly relieved. The article stated that the car belonging to the millionaire's son
had been found by a laborer employed on the estate as he came to his work very early in the
morning. The car, which was badly smashed up, bore the mark of a bullet in a rear tire and
one in the lower part of the body. It was believed that the young man, being pursued by bandits
and having attempted to escape, had had his car riddled by bullets and had been thrown into
the ditch.

"There are grave reasons for supposing," the article went on to state, "since no trace of the
young man has yet been found, that he has been either kidnapped for ransom or, having been
killed by a stray bullet, has been buried somewhere in the forest preserve.

"Bands of armed men are searching the woods and every available police officer and detective
has been put on the case. A reward of $5,000 has been offered by the father for any information
which may lead to the discovery of the whereabouts of his son."

"Whew!" exclaimed Curlie, mopping his brow. "What a rumpus!"

Suddenly he sat up straight. "Doesn't say one word about that wireless apparatus in the car.
How about that?"

He sat with wrinkled brow for a moment.

"Ah!" he slapped his knee, "I have it! The laborer of course came directly to his master. The
shrewd old millionaire, guessing that his son had been breaking radio laws, had all of that
equipment removed before the public was let in on the deal. He bribed the laborer to secrecy
on that point and there you are."

Again his brow wrinkled. "Five thousand dollars!" he whispered. "That's a lot of money. I could
supply some valuable information which might entitle me to the five thousand. Question is,
do I want to risk it? The thing that's happened is about this, far as I can figure it out:
Our young amateur radio friend, when his auto turned turtle, hiked off into the woods. For
a time he stayed there. Then, when nothing happened for some time, he came sneaking back. When
he found I'd taken his number plate and some parts of his radio equipment, he guessed right
away that I was connected with the radio secret service. He's hiding right now, unless I miss
my guess, with some of his rich young friends.

"I might tell all that and I might get the reward, but supposing something really had happened?
Oh, boy, what a mess!

"And yet," he mused, after a moment, "I've done nothing to be ashamed of. I'm an officer of
the law. I did what I did because a fellow was resisting arrest. Ho, well, I'll just let things
stand and simmer. Something may come to the top yet."

CHAPTER VIII

CURLIE MEETS A MILLIONAIRE

It was a tense situation for Curlie. He spent an uneasy night and that in spite of the fact
that the air was particularly free from trouble.

"Hang it all," he exclaimed once as, dashing the receiver from his head, he sprang from his
chair to pace the floor of the secret tower room, "I'd welcome something in the line of trouble.
This eternal thinking--thinking--thinking, drives me wild. What to do, that's the question.
Suppose I'd ought to go out and tell Ardmore what I know. If a millionaire father's like any
other father, I guess he's pretty well wrought up by now. But if I go, and if I tell him the
whole truth, I'm as sure as I am of anything that it will get me into a mess and that's the
sort of thing I don't like."

Glancing down, his eye was caught by Coles' report of the night before. Dropping once more
into his chair, he began going through the messages written there. When he came to the one
sent out by the boy whose car he had wrecked, he pondered over it for a long time.

"'Island, airplane, map, much gold; airplane, map, island, gold,'" he repeated. "What does
one make out of that? It might be that this boy has been planning a secret voyage with some
other chap. Certainly sounds like it. Other messages were the same kind. By Jove! Perhaps he's
skipped out and gone on that trip and is not hiding out at all! Let's see."

Taking down a file he drew forth a bunch of message records clipped together. They were those
sent by the moving operator on 600, the millionaire's son.

A long time he studied over these.

"Seems to sort of prove my theory," he muttered once. "Can't be sure though."

Then, suddenly he sat up straight. "That's the idea." He slapped his knee. "The very thing!
Why didn't I think of that before? If he doesn't shew up by morning I'll do it. I'll just take
these records over to Ardmore and suggest to him that they may shed some light on the subject.
Don't need to tell him I was in on the wrecking of the car at all. That wouldn't help any.
These records might. And if I can help to find him and bring him back, then, oh, boy! Oh you
baby fortune! Five thousand big, red, round dollars!"

He sat back trying to measure the meaning of the possession of five thousand dollars which
did not have to be spent for bed, board and clothing. At last he gave it up in despair.

The morning papers assured the interested city that the son of their money king was still missing.
To make sure that this report was correct, Curlie called up the mansion and inquired about
it. When he learned that it was indeed true, he requested the servant who answered the telephone
to inform the millionaire that a representative of the Secret Service of the Air would arrive
at his residence with copies of certain radiophone messages sent out by his son previous to
his mysterious disappearance, which might shed some light on the subject.

Shortly after that he leaped into the driver's seat on the Humming Bird and motored away to
the west.

Arrived at the Forest Preserve, he backed the car into the deserted roadway in the forest at
the very spot where he and Joe had concealed themselves the night of the race.

"Have to leave you here, old thing," he whispered. "If a fellow were to pull up that driveway
in such a rakish craft as you are, they might think him crazy and throw him out.

"Well here goes," he whispered to himself, as, having rounded the last clump of decorative
shrubbery, he came in sight of the red stone mansion.

"Whew! What a stunner!" whispered Curlie to himself.

The sun was tipping the parapets of that mansion with gold; the dew sparkled on the perfectly
kept green. It was indeed a beautiful picture.

Tiptoeing up the steps, he was about to lift the heavy bronze knocker when a porter opened
the door and motioned him to enter.

"Are you the man?" he asked in a low tone.

"I'm the boy who wired about the messages."

"Step right this way. He's waiting."

Curlie's heart beat fast. Was he to be ushered at once into the august presence of the magnate?
He had pictured to himself hours of waiting, interviews by private secretaries and all that.

And yet here he was. In a large room furnished in rich mahogany, seemingly the rich man's home
office, he was being greeted by a stout, broad-shouldered, brisk and healthy-looking man who
was assuring him that he was speaking to J. Anson Ardmore himself and inviting him to sit down.

With his head in a whirl, he managed to get himself into a chair. And all this while he was
telling himself things; things like this: "Curlie, old boy, this is going to be strenuous.
This man is powerful, magnetic, almost hypnotizing. He will find out as much as he can from
you. He will tell as little as is necessary to attain his end. To him all life is a game, a
game in which he conceals much and discovers all that lies in his opponent's hand. He probably
knows you have the goods on his son. Perhaps he is merely playing a game about this vanishing
son. He may know where he is all the time. If so, he'll want to know what you know, and what
you are going to do. You must be wise--wise as a serpent."

"Well?" the magnate spoke in a brisk way. "My butler tells me you have some messages."

"Yes, sir."

"Sent by my missing son?"

"Yes, sir."

"And may I ask," the magnate's face was a mask, not a muscle moved, "how you happened to be
in possession of these messages?"

Curlie could hear his own heart beat, but he held his ground. "Since I am attached to the government
radiophone staff, it is my duty to catch and record all unfair and illegally sent messages,
to record them as evidence and for future reference."

Curlie fancied he saw the man start. The words that followed were spoken still in a cold, collected
tone.

"These messages you say were unfair?"

"Unfair and illegally sent."

"How illegal?"

"They were sent with exceedingly high power and on 600 meter wave lengths. Such high power
is unlawful for all amateurs and the use of 600 is granted to ships and ship stations alone.

"Ah!"

For a second the man appeared to reflect. Then suddenly:

"We are wasting time. My son has mysteriously disappeared. I have reason to fear foul play.
Let me assure you that I know nothing about his whereabouts and, previous to this moment, that
I have known nothing regarding these illegally sent messages."

"But--" began Curlie.

"You doubt my word," his voice grew stern and hard as he read the incredulity in Curlie's eyes.
"Young man," he fairly thundered, "fix this in your mind: No man ever has risen or ever will
rise to my present position through treachery or deceit. When I say a thing is so, by thunder
it _is_ so!"

He struck his desk a terrific blow.

"But a--"

Curlie caught himself just in time. He had been about to reveal the fact that he was aware
of the presence of the wireless set in the auto the night the millionaire's son disappeared.

"I can't see just how your messages could aid us in finding my son." The magnate spoke more
calmly. "However, all things are possible. May I see the copies?"

"Of course," said Curlie, hesitatingly, "this is a private matter. Few persons know of our
service. It is the desire of the government that they should not know. These are not for publication.
Do you understand that?"

"You have my word."

Curlie passed the sheath of papers over the desk.

Slowly, one by one, the great man read them. His movement was not hurried. He digested every
word. Like many another great man he had formed the habit of gathering, as far as possible,
the full meaning of any set of facts by his own careful research, before allowing his opinion
to be influenced by others.

He had gone half through the pack when a door over at the right opened and a girl, dressed
in some filmy stuff which brought out the smoothness of her neck and arms and the beauty of
her complexion, entered the room.

Curlie caught his breath. It was the girl he had seen on the horse that morning, the magnate's
daughter.

She had advanced halfway to her father's desk before she became aware of Curlie's presence.
Then she started back with a stammered: "I--I beg your pardon."

"It's all right." The first smile Curlie had seen on the great man's face now curved about
his mouth. "You may remain. This is no secret chamber."

"Fa--father," she faltered, gripping at her throat, "does he know--know anything--about--about
Vincent?"

"I can't tell yet. I am going over the messages. Please be seated."

The girl sank into a deep leather-cushioned chair. Without looking at her Curlie was aware
of the fact that she was studying him, perhaps trying to make up her mind where she had seen
him before. This made him exceedingly uncomfortable. He was greatly relieved when at last the
magnate spoke.

"Gladys," he addressed the girl, "did you say you found some sort of map in Vincent's room?"

"Oh, yes," she sprang to her feet. "A photograph of a very strange looking map and also one
of some queer foreign writing."

"Will you run and get those photographs?"

"Yes, father."

"It's strange," the older man mused after she had gone. "I don't understand it at all. These
messages, they are--"

"If you please--" Curlie broke in.

"Wait!" commanded the other, holding up his hand for silence. "Let us have no opinions before
all of the evidence is in. That map may aid us in forming correct conclusions."

CHAPTER IX

A MYSTERIOUS MAP

It was indeed a curious map which had been reproduced on the large photographic print which
Gladys Ardmore placed on the desk before her father.

Motioning Curlie to come forward and examine it with them, the magnate rose from his chair
to bend over the map. As Curlie stood there looking down at it, the girl in her eagerness bent
down so close to him that he felt her warm breath on his cheek.

Nothing, however, could have drawn his gaze from that map. Wrinkled, torn in places, patched,
browned with age, smirched by many finger marks, all of which were faithfully reproduced by
the freshly printed photograph, it still gave promise of revealing many a mystery if one could
but read it correctly.

It showed both land and water. Here on the land was a picture of a castle and there on the
water a ship. The shore of the land was not drawn as are maps with which we are in these days
familiar, but was cut up in curious geometric forms which surely could not faithfully represent
the true lines of the shore. Towns were shown, but only on the shoreline, their names printed
in by hand in such small letters as would require a magnifying glass to read them. Crossing
and recrossing the water in every conceivable direction were innumerable straight lines. About
the edge of the map were eight faces of children. Their cheeks puffed out as if blowing, they
appeared to represent the wind that blew from certain quarters.

All the writing was in some foreign language. In the lower left-hand corner was what appeared
to be the name of the maker but this was so blotted out as to be unreadable.

"Huh!" The magnate straightened up. "That's a strange map and appears to be very ancient, but
I can hardly see how it is going to help us with our present problem."

"There is still the writing," suggested Gladys, turning over the other photograph.

"That," said Mr. Ardmore, after a moment's study of it, "is written in some strange tongue
and is, I take it, unintelligible to us all."

"It's a photograph of the back of the map," suggested Curlie, pointing out certain spots where
the wrinkles and tears were the same.

"My French teacher will be here at ten o'clock. He knows several languages. Perhaps he could
help us," suggested Gladys.

"We will leave that to him," said her father. "Now about these messages," he went on, turning
to Curlie. "What is your theory?"

Stammeringly Curlie proceeded to explain the idea which had come to him, the notion that Vincent
Ardmore and some pal of his had been planning a secret trip of some sort.

"That is entirely possible," said Ardmore. "Vincent is daring, even rash at times. Anchor that were thither that we had not himself will be possibly with Katherine.

go, be careful. Careful. He's a bad man and the stakes are big!" The whisper ceased. The silence
that followed it was ghostly.

"And that," Curlie whispered softly, "came all the way from my dear old home town. She thought
I was still in the secret tower room. Fine chance of my following that fellow up north. But
when I get back I'll investigate. There may be something big there, just as she says there
is. Yes, I'll look into it when I get back--if I do get back."

He shivered as he caught the howl of the wind in the rigging. Then, tuning his instrument back
to 600, he listened once more for some message from the seaplane, the _Stormy Petrel_.

CHAPTER XV

S. O. S.

The spot of light which raced across the waters of the sea where no land was to be seen, where
the black surface of the swiftly changing waters shone always beneath the occupants of the
seaplane, took on an ever widening circle. There appeared to be no end to Alfred Brightwood's
belief that somewhere in the midst of all this waste of waters there was an island.

Vincent Ardmore had long since given up hope of becoming rich by this mad adventure. His only
hope, the one that gave strength to his arms benumbed by long clinging to the flashlight and
new sight to his eyes, weary with watching, was that they might discover some bit of land,
a coral island, perhaps, where they might find refuge from the sea until a craft, called to
their aid, might rescue them.

The thought of returning to the mainland he had all but abandoned. The gas in the tank was
too low for that; at least he was quite certain it must be.

There was a chance, of course, that if they alighted upon the water and sent out an S. O. S.,
the international call for aid, they would be answered by some near-by ship. But this seemed
only a remote possibility. He dared not hope it would happen. They were far from any regular
course of trans-Atlantic vessels and too far from shore to be picked up by a coast vessel or
a fishing smack. The very fact that this island, marked so plainly on the ancient map, had
been in this particular spot, so remote from the main sea-roads, had strengthened their belief
that during all the centuries of travel it had been lost from man's memory and hidden from
his view. Now this very isolation, since they were unable to locate this island, if indeed
it existed at all, threatened to be their undoing.

Still they circled and circled with great, untiring sweeps. At last, releasing the searchlight,
Vincent put his lips to a speaking tube.

"Let's light," he grumbled. "I'm dead. What's the use?"

"What else can we do but keep looking?" Alfred answered.

"Take a look at the gas. Maybe it will carry us back."

Even as he spoke, a strange thing happened. The air appeared suddenly to have dropped from
beneath the plane. Straight down for fifty feet she dropped.

With the utmost difficulty Alfred succeeded in preventing her from taking a nose dive into the sea.

"She--she bumped," he managed to pant at last. "Something the matter with the air."

And indeed there was something about the atmospheric conditions which they had not sensed.
Busy as they had been they had not seen the black bank of clouds to the northeast of them.
With the wild rush of air from sheer speed, they had not felt the increasing strength of the
gale. Once Vincent had fancied that the sea, far beneath them, seemed disturbed, but so far
beneath them was it that he could not tell.

Now in surprise and consternation, as if to steady his reeling brain, he gripped the fuselage
beside him while he shrilled into the tube:

"Look! Look over there! Lightning!"

"Watch out, I'm going down," warned the other boy. "Going to light."

To do this was no easy task. Three times they swooped low, to skim along just over the crest
of the waves, only to tilt upward again.

"Looks bad," grumbled the young pilot.

The fourth time, he dared it. With the spray spattering his goggles, he sent the plane right
into the midst of it. For a second it seemed that nothing could save them, that the wave they
had nose-dived into would throw their plane end for end and land her on her back, with her
two occupants hopeless prisoners strapped head down to drown beneath her.

But at last the powerful motors conquered and, tossed by the ever increasing swells, the plane
rode the sea like the stormy petrel after which she had been named.

"Quick!" exclaimed Alfred as the motors ceased to throb. "Strip off your harness and get back
to the tank."

A moment later Vincent was making a perilous journey to the gas tank. Twice the wind all but
swept him into the sea; once a wave drenched him with its chilling waters. When at last he
reached his destination it was only to utter a groan; more gas had been used than he had dared
think.

"Can't--can't make it," he mumbled as he struggled back to his place.

"Have to send out an S. O. S. then. What wave length do you use?

"You ought to know," exclaimed Vincent almost savagely. "You were the one who insisted on using
it when we were making up our plans."

"Six hundred? Oh, yes," Alfred said indifferently. "Well, what of it?"

"Just this much of it," said Vincent thoughtfully. "I've been going over and over it in my
mind the last little while. What if we send out our S. O. S. now and some selfish landlubber
such as we were is talking about matters of little importance and muddles our message? We might
be left to drown."

"Aw, can that sob stuff," grumbled Alfred angrily. "Are you going to send that S. O. S. or am I?"

"I will," said Vincent, preparing to climb to a position on the plane above him where the radiophone
was located. "But"--he suddenly began to sway dizzily--"but where are we?"

He sank back into his seat. For a full moment, with the waves tossing the plane about and the
black clouds mounting higher and higher, the two boys stared at one another in silence. Yes,
where were they? Who could tell? They were not trained mariners. They could not have taken
a reckoning even had they been in possession of the needed instruments.

"Why," said Alfred hesitatingly, "we must be somewhere near that spot where the island was
supposed to be located. That's as near as we can come to it. Send out that latitude and longitude;
then we'll climb back into the air. We'll be safer there than on the water and we can keep
the searchlight shooting out flashes in all directions. A ship coming to our aid will see the
light."

"If they come," Vincent whispered.

"Hurry!" exclaimed Alfred, as a giant wave, rising above its mates, threatened to tear their
plane into shreds.

With benumbed and trembling fingers the boy unwrapped his instruments, adjusted a coil, twisted
a knob and threw in his switch. Then his heart stood still. The motor did not start. Had it
been dampened and short-circuited? Would it refuse to go? Were they already lost?

Just as he was giving up in despair, there came a humming sound and a moment later the well-known
signal of distress had been flashed out across the waves. Three times he repeated it. Three
times in a few sharp words he told their general location and their plight. Then with wildly
beating heart, he pressed the receivers to his ears and awaited a reply.

A moment passed, two, three, four; but there came no answering call. Only the buzz and snap
of the ever-increasing static greeted his straining ears.

Once more he sent out the message; again he listened. Still no response.

"C'm'on," came from the boy below. "It's getting dangerous. You can get a message off in the
air. Gotta get out o' here. Gotta climb. May not be able to make it even now."

As the other boy glanced down at the white-capped waves all about them he realized that his
companion spoke the truth.

Hurriedly rewrapping his instruments, all but the receivers, which by the aid of an extension
he brought down with him, he made his way to his seat and strapped on his harness.

"All right," he breathed.

Once more the motors thundered. For a long distance they raced through blinding spray. Little
by little this diminished until with a swoop, like a sea gull, the magnificent plane shot upward.
The next instant they felt a dash of cold rain upon their cheeks. Was the storm upon them?
Or was this merely a warning dash which had reached them far in advance of the deluge? For
the moment they could not tell.

CHAPTER XVI

A CONFESSION

For an hour Curlie Carson had been seated in the radiophone cabin of the _Kittlewake_. During
that time his delicately adjusted amplifier and his wonderful ears had enabled him to pick
up many weird and unusual messages. Listening in at sea before a great storm is like wandering
on the beach after that same storm; you never can tell what you may pick up. But though fragments
of many messages had come to him, not one of any importance to the _Kittlewake_ had reached
his ears. If during that time any message from the _Stormy Petrel_ had been sent out, it had
been lost in the crash and snap of static which now kept up a constant din in his ears.

Again doubt assailed him. He had no positive knowledge that the boys in the plane had gone
in search of that mysterious island of the old chart. They might, for all he knew, be at this
moment enjoying a rich feast on some island off the coast of America.

"Cuba, for instance," he told himself. "Not at all impossible. Being damp state that code, cable might have just had to be all in absurd,

of a white hand above a wave. He could not be sure; it might have been a speck of foam. Only
one thing he could be sure of; his throbbing brain told it to him over and over: Alfred Brightwood,
his friend, was gone--gone forever. The sea had swallowed him up.

CHAPTER XXI

THE BOATS ARE GONE

When Curlie Carson had fastened the mysterious post-shaped affair to the springs of his berth,
he fought his way against wind, waves and darkness back to the radiophone cabin.

"Anything come in?" he asked as he shook the dampness from his clothing.

"Nothing I could make out," shouted Joe. "Got something all jumbled up with static once but
couldn't make it out." Rising, he took the receiver from his head and handed it to Curlie.
Then, as the craft took a sudden plunge, he leaped for a seat. Missing it, he went sprawling
upon the floor.

In spite of the seriousness of their dilemma, the girl let forth a joyous peal of laughter.
Joe's antics as he attempted to rise were too ridiculous for words.

There was tonic for all of them in that laugh. They felt better because of it.

Some moments after that, save for the wild beat of the storm, there was silence. Then, clapping
the receivers to his ears, Curlie uttered an exclamation. He was getting something, or at least
thought he was. Yes, now he did get it, a whisper. Faint, indistinct, mingled with static,
yet audible enough, there came the four words:

"Hello there, Curlie! Hello!"

At that moment the currents of electricity playing from cloud to cloud set up such a rattle
and jangle of static that he heard no more.

"It's that girl in my old home town, in that big hotel," he told himself. "To think that her
whisper would carry over all those miles in such a gale! She's sending on 600. Wonder why?"

"Ah, well," he breathed, when nothing further had come in, "I'll unravel that mystery in good
time, providing we get out of this mess and get back to that home burg of ours. But now--"

Suddenly he started and stared. There had come a loud bump against the cabin; then another
and another.

"It's the boats!" he shouted. "They've torn loose. Should have known they would. Should have
thought of that. Here!" He handed the receiver to Joe and once more dashed out into the storm.

The _Kittlewake_ carried two lifeboats. As he struggled toward where they should have been,
some object swinging past him barely missed his head.

Instantly he dropped to the deck, at the same time gripping at the rail to save himself from
being washed overboard.

"That," he told himself, "was a block swinging from a rope. The boat on this side is gone.
Worse luck for that! We--we might need 'em before we're through with this."

Slowly he worked his way along the rail toward the stern. Now and again the waves that washed
the deck lifted him up to slam him down again.

"Quit that!" he muttered hoarsely. "Can't you let a fellow alone."

Arrived at last on the other side, he rose to his knees and tried to peer above him to the
place where the second lifeboat should be swinging. A flash of lightning aided his vision.
A groan escaped his lips.

"Gone!" he muttered. "Should have thought of that! But," he told himself, "there's still the raft!"

The raft, built of boards and gas-filled tubes, was lashed to the deck forward. Thither he
made his difficult way.

To his great relief, he found the raft still safe. Since it was thrashing about, he uncoiled
a rope closely lashed to the side of a cabin and with tremendous effort succeeded in making
the raft snug.

"There, now, you'll remain with us for a spell," he muttered.

Clinging there for a moment, he appeared to debate some important question.

"Guess I ought to do it," he told himself at last. "And I'd better do it now. You never can
tell what will happen next and if worst comes to worst it's our only chance."

Fighting his way back to his cabin, he returned presently with the post-shaped affair which
he had lashed to the springs of his berth.

This he now lashed to the stout slats of wood and crossbars of metal on the raft. When he had
finished it appeared to be part of the raft.

"There, my sweet baby," he murmured, "sleep here, rocked on the cradle of the deep, until your
papa wants you. You're a beautiful and wonderful child!"

Then, weary, water-soaked, chilled to the bone, stupefied by the wild beat of the storm, aching
in every muscle but not downhearted, he fought his way back to the radio cabin.

       *       *       *       *       *

Nature has been kind to man. She has so made him that he is incapable of feeling all the tragedy
and sorrow of a terrible situation at the time when it bursts upon him. Vincent Ardmore, as
he clung to the wrecked plane, with his companion gone from him forever, did not sense the
full horror of his position. He realized little more than the fact that he was chilled to the
bone, and that the wind and waves were beating upon him unmercifully.

Then, gradually there stole into his benumbed mind the thought that he might improve his position.
The platform above him still stood clear of the waves. Could he but loosen the straps which
bound him to the fuselage, could he but climb to that platform, he would at least be free for
a time from the rude beating of the black waters which rolled over him incessantly.

With the numbed, trembling fingers of one hand he struggled with the stubborn, water-soaked
straps while with the other he clung to the rods of the rigging. To loosen his grip for an
instant, once the straps were unfastened, meant almost certain death.

After what seemed an eternity of time the last strap gave way and, with a wild pounding of
his heart, he gripped the rods and began to climb.

As he tumbled upon the platform, new hope set the blood racing through his veins.

"There might yet be a chance," he murmured, almost joyfully; "the storm is breaking." His eyes
wandered to the fleeting clouds. "Dawn's coming, too. I--I--why, I might send a message. The
motor's gone dead, of course, but there are still storage batteries. If only the insulations
are good. If water has not soaked in anywhere!"

With trembling fingers he tested the batteries. A bright flash of fire told him they were still
alive. Then with infinite care he adjusted the instruments. At last he tapped a wire and a
grating rattle went forth.

"She's still good," he exulted.

Then slowly, distinctly, he talked into the transmitter, talked as he might had he been surrounded
by the cozy comforts of home. He gave his name, the name of his aircraft; told of his perilous
position; gave his approximate location and asked for aid. Only once his voice broke and fell
to a whisper. That was when he tried to tell of the sad fate of his companion.

Having come to the end, he adjusted the receiver to his ears and sat there listening.

Suddenly his face grew tense with expectation. He was getting something, an answer to his message.

For a full moment he sat there tense, motionless. Then, suddenly, without warning, a new catastrophe
assailed him. A giant wave, leaping high, came crashing down upon the wreckage of the plane.
There followed a snapping and crashing of braces. When the wave had passed, the platform to
which he clung floated upon the sea. His radiophone equipment was water-soaked, submerged.
His storage batteries had toppled over to plunge into the sea.

So there he clung, a single individual on a mass of wreckage, helpless and well-nigh hopeless
in the midst of a vast ocean whose waves were even now subsiding after a terrific storm.

CHAPTER XXII

THE WRECK OF THE _KITTLEWAKE_

"I'm getting a message!" exclaimed Curlie excitedly. "Getting it distinct and plain, and it's--it's
from them."

"Oh, is it?" the girl sprang from the seat.

"From your brother. They've been wrecked. They're not on an island but on the sea. Safe, though,
only--" he paused to listen closely again--"I can't just make out what he says about his companion."

"Oh! Please, please let me listen!" Gladys Ardmore gripped his arm.

Quickly Curlie snatched the receiver from his head and pressed it down over her tangled mass
of brown hair.

She caught but a few words, then the voice broke suddenly off, but such words as they were;
such words of comfort. The voice of her only brother had come stealing across the storm to
her, assuring her that he was still alive; that there was still a chance that he might be saved.
She pressed the receivers to her ears in the hopes of hearing more.

In the meantime Curlie was answering the message. In quiet, reassuring tones he gave their
location and told of their purpose in those waters and ended with the assurance that if it
were humanly possible the rescue should be accomplished.

"And we will save them," he exclaimed. "At least we'll save your brother."

"You don't think--" Gladys did not finish.

"I hardly know what to think about your brother's chum," Curlie said thoughtfully. "But this
we do know: Your brother is clinging to the wreckage of a seaplane out there somewhere. And
we will save him. See! the storm is about at an end and morning is near!" He pointed to the
window, where the first faint glow of dawn was showing.

For a moment all were silent. Then suddenly, without warning, there came a grinding crash that
sent a shudder through the _Kittlewake_ from stem to stern.

"What was that?" exclaimed Joe Marion, springing to his feet from the floor where he had been
thrown.

"We struck something!" Curlie was out upon the deck like a shot.

He all but collided with the skipper, who had deserted his wheel.

"We 'it somethin'," shouted the skipper, "an' she's sinkin' by the larboard bow. Gotta' git
off 'er quick. Boats are gone! Everythin's gone."

"No," said Curlie calmly, "the raft forward is safely lashed on."

The engineer appeared from below. The engine had already ceased its throbbing.

"She's fillin' fast," he commented in a slow drawl.

"You two get the raft loose," said Curlie. "I'll get the girl."

Dashing to his stateroom he seized two blankets and a large section of oiled cloth. With these
he dashed to the radio room.

"Got to get out quick!" he exclaimed.

Before she could realize what he was doing, he had seized the girl and had wrapped her round
and round with the blankets, then with the oiled cloth. Joe had rushed out to help with the
raft. Curlie carried the girl outside and, when the raft with the others aboard was afloat,
handed her down to the skipper.

"Try and keep her dry," he said calmly. "We'll all get soaked, but we can stand it for a long
time; a girl can't."

"Now push off!" he commanded. "Get good and clear so that the wreck will not draw you down."

"You'll come with us," said the skipper sternly. Curlie had not intended going with them. He
had meant to remain behind and send a call for aid, then to swim for the raft. But now, as
he saw the water gaining on the stricken craft, he realized how dangerous and futile it would
be. He was needed on the raft to help get her away. Having seen all this at a flash he said:

"All right; I'll go." Having dropped to the raft, and seized a short paddle, he joined Joe
and the engineer in forcing the unwieldy raft away from the side of the doomed _Kittlewake_.

They were none too soon, for scarcely two minutes could have elapsed when with a rush that
nearly engulfed them the boat keeled up on end and sank from sight.

"And now," said Joe addressing Curlie as he settled back to a seat on one of the gas-filled
tubes, "you can test out what you said once about keeping your radiophone dry and tuned up
under any and every circumstance. Suppose you tune her up now and get off an S.O.S."

There was a smile on the lips of the undaunted young operator as he said with a drawl:

"Give me time, Joe, old scout, give me time."

The girl, staring out from her wrappings, appeared to fear that the two boys had gone delirious
over this new catastrophe.

But only brave and hardy spirits can joke in the midst of disaster, and as for Curlie, he really
did have one more trick up his sleeve.

As the old skipper sat staring away at the point where his craft had disappeared beneath the
dark waters, he murmured:

"'Twasn't much we 'it; fragment from an iceberg 'er somethin', but 'twas enough. An' a good
little craft she was too."

The storm had passed, but the waves were still rolling high. The raft tilted to such an angle
that now they were all in danger of being pitched headforemost into the sea, and now in danger
of falling backward into the trough of the waves.

Soaked to the skin, shivering, miserable, the boys and men clung to the raft, while the girl
bewailed the fact that she was not permitted to suffer with them. Wrapped as she was, and carefully
guarded from the on-rush of the waves, she escaped all the miserable damp and chill of it.

"Shows you're a real sport," Curlie's lips, blue with cold, attempted a smile, "but you've
got to let us play the gentleman, even out here."

When the waves had receded somewhat, Curlie began digging at one of the tubes beneath his feet.
Having at length unfastened it, he stood it on end to unscrew some fastenings and lift off the top.

"Canisters of water and some emergency rations!" exclaimed Joe, as he peered inside. "Great stuff!"

They had taken a swallow of water apiece and were preparing to munch some hardtack and chocolate
when Gladys exclaimed:

"Look over there. What's that?"

"There's nothing," said the engineer after studying the waves for a moment.

"Oh, yes there was!" the girl insisted emphatically. "Something showed up on the crest of a
wave. It's in the trough of the wave now. It'll come up again."

"Bit of wreckage from our yacht," suggested Joe.

"Not much wreckage on 'er," said the skipper. "All washed off 'er long before she sank."

"What could it be then?" The girl was fairly holding her breath. "It couldn't be--"

"Don't get your hopes up too high," cautioned Curlie. "Of course miracles do happen, but not
so very often."

CHAPTER XXIII

THE MIRACLE

They were all straining their eyes when at last the thing appeared once more on the crest of
the wave.

"Wreckage! A mass of it!" came from the skipper.

"And--and there's a hand!" exclaimed Curlie.

"The paddles, boys! The paddles! Every 'and of you, hup an' at it," shouted the skipper.

The wildest excitement prevailed, yet out of it all there came quick and concerted action.
Three paddles flashed as, straining every muscle, they strove to bring the clumsy raft nearer
the wreck. With tears in her eyes, the girl begged and implored them to unwrap her and allow
her to have a hand in the struggle.

A minute passed. No longer chilled but steaming from violent exertion, they strained eager
eyes to catch another glimpse of the wreck.

"There--there it is!" exclaimed the girl, overcome with joy. "You're gaining! You're gaining!"

Five minutes passed. They gained half the distance. Eight minutes more; the hand on the wreckage
rose again. They were getting nearer.

Suddenly the girl uttered a piercing cry of joy:

"It is Vincent! It is! It is!"

And she was right. A moment later, as they dragged the all but senseless form from the seaplane,
they recognized him at once as the millionaire's son.

He had drifted in the benumbing water so long that had they been delayed for another hour they
would have found nothing more than a corpse awaiting them.

As Curlie tore Vincent's sodden outer garments from him he saw the girl carefully unrolling
the blankets and oiled covering from about her. He did not protest. To him the thought of seeing
this girl half drowned and chilled through by the spray which even now at times dashed over
the raft, was heartbreaking, but he knew it was necessary if the life of her brother was to
be saved.

"Brave girl!" he murmured as he wrapped Vincent in the coverings and passed him on to the skipper.

"And now," he said, "the time has come to think of other things. I believe the waves have sufficiently
subsided to enable us to dare it."

He fumbled once more at the raft, at last to bring up a long, post-shaped affair.

"More rations," murmured Joe, swallowing his last bite of hardtack; "a regular commissary.
But why get them out at this time?"

"You wait," smiled Curlie.

He was standing up. After telling Joe to steady him, he began tearing away at the upper end
of the mysterious package. In a moment, he took out some limp, rubber affairs.

"Toy balloons," jeered Joe.

"Something like that," Curlie smiled.

He next brought out a small brass retort and a tiny spirit lamp.

"Lucky our matches are dry," he murmured, after unwrapping some oiled cloth and lighting the
spirit lamp with one of the matches inclosed.

After firmly tying the end of a toy balloon over the mouth of the retort he held the spirit
lamp beneath the bowl of the retort. At once the balloon began to expand.

"Chemicals already in the retort," he explained.

When the balloon was sufficiently inflated, he quickly tied it at the mouth, then began inflating
another.

"The gas is very buoyant," he explained. "Hold that," he said as he passed the string to the
engineer.

"There's enough," he said quietly when the third had been filled.

He next drew forth some shiny fine copper wire coiled about some round, insulated bars.

When he had fastened the balloons to one end of the bars, he attached a strong cord to the
balloons, then allowed them to rise, at the same time paying out the strands of copper wire.

"Not very heavy wire for an aerial," he remarked, "but heavy enough. We'll have a perpendicular
aerial, which is better than horizontal, and it'll hang pretty high. All that's in our favor."

When the balloons had risen to a height which allowed the aerial, to which was attached a heavier
insulated wire, to float free, he gave the cord to the engineer and began busying himself at
putting together what appeared to be a small windmill with curved, brass fans.

"A windmill," he explained, "is the surest method of obtaining a little power. Always a little
breeze floating round. Enough to turn a wheel. This one is connected direct with a small generator.
Gives power enough for a radiophone. Might use batteries but they might go dead on you. Windmill
and generator is as good after ten years as ten days.

"There you are," he heaved a sigh of relief, as he struck the transmitter which he had taken
from his apparently inexhaustible "bag of tricks."

"Unless I miss my guess, we have a perfectly good radiophone outfit of fair power. All the
rest of it is stowed down there in the bottom. We should be heard distinctly at from a hundred
to five hundred miles. In the future," he smiled, "every lifeboat and raft will be equipped
with one of these handy little radiophone outfits, which are really not very expensive."

Then, with all eyes fixed upon him, he began to converse with the unseen and unknown, who,
sailing somewhere on that vast sweep of water, were, they hoped, to become their rescuers.

In perfectly natural tones he spoke of their catastrophe and their present predicament. He
gave their approximate location and the names of their party. This after an interval of two
minutes, he repeated.

Then, suddenly his lips parted in a smile. The others watched him with strained attention.
After a minute had elapsed, he said with apparent satisfaction:

"We'll await your arrival with unmixed pleasure.

"The Steamship Torrence," he explained, "in crossing the Atlantic was driven two hundred miles
off her course. She is now only about seventy-five miles from us. Being a fast boat, she should
reach us in three or four hours.

"And now," he said with a smile, "since we have no checker-board on deck and are entirely deprived
of musical instruments of any kind, perhaps you would like to hear me tell why I was sure the
mysterious island which has caused us so much grief, did not exist."

"By the way," he said turning to Vincent, "do you chance to have the original of that old map
with you?"

The boy pointed to his aviator's sodden leather coat. Although he had gained much strength
from the warm blankets, he had found himself unable to speak of the tragedy which had befallen
his companion on the _Stormy Petrel_. Now as he saw Curlie draw the water-soaked map from the
pocket of his coat, a look of horror overspread his face and he muttered hoarsely:

"Throw it into the sea. It brings nothing but bad luck."

"No, no," said Curlie, "we won't do that."

"Then you must keep it," the other boy exclaimed. "I don't want ever to see it again. Alfred
made me a present of it just before we hopped off."

"All right," said Curlie, "but you are parting with a thing of some value."

"Value!" exclaimed Vincent. Then he sat staring at Curlie in silence as much as to say: "You
too must have been bitten by the gold-bug." But that Curlie had not been bitten by that dangerous
and poisonous insect will be proved, I think, by the pages which follow.

CHAPTER XXIV

THE STORY OF THE MAP

"You see," said Curlie, tapping the soggy bit of vellum which he held in his hand, "the trouble
with this map is, not that it is not genuine, but that it's too old. This map," he paused for
emphasis, "this map was made in fourteen hundred and forty-six."

Gladys Ardmore gasped. Her brother stared in astonishment.

"It's a fact!" declared Curlie emphatically.

"You see," he went on, "the day I was in the library with Miss Gladys I saw an exact reproduction
of this map in a large volume. At the same time I read a description of it and a brief account
of its history. It seems it was lost sight of about a century ago. There were copies, but the
original was gone.

"I concluded at once that the map had somehow come into the hands of Alfred Brightwood. Since
I was convinced that this was the truth, and since I had read the writing about the gold discovered
on the mysterious island charted there, I decided that it would be wise to find out whether
or not it were possible that this strange story might be true. I found my answer in a bound
volume of Scottish Geographic Magazines in a series of articles entitled 'The So-Called Mythical
Islands of the Atlantic.'

"It seems that there is fairly good proof that a number of vessels landed on the North American
continent before Columbus did. Driven out of their course or lured on by hopes of gold and
adventure, these ships from time to time discovered and rediscovered lands to the west of Ireland.
They thought of the land as islands and gave them names. The island of Brazil was one of them.
If you were to consult this map I have here you would find the island of Brazil indicated by
a circle which is nearly as large as Ireland, yet if you were to cruise all over the waters
in the vicinity of this supposed island you would find only the restless old ocean.

"What's the answer then?" he smiled. "Just this: These ancient sea rovers didn't have any accurate
way of telling where they were at a given time on the sea, so they had to guess at it. Carried
on by winds and currents, they often traveled much farther than they thought. They landed on
the continent of North America and thought it an island. When they came back to Europe they
tried to locate the land they had discovered on a map, and missed it by only a thousand miles
or so.

"Our ancient friend who wrote of his experiences on the back of this map had doubtless been
carried to some point in Central or South America, for there was, even in those days, plenty
of gold to be found in those regions."

"So you see," he turned to Vincent with a smile, "you went five hundred miles out to sea for
the purpose of rediscovering America. Not much chance of success. Anyway that's what I thought,
and that is why I dashed off on a wild race in the _Kittlewake_. And that's why we're here."

Silence followed the ending of Curlie's narrative. There seemed to be nothing more to say.

So they sat there staring at the sea for a long time.

The silence was at last broken by the skipper's announcement:

"Smoke on the larboard bow."

It was true. Their relief was at hand.

Almost immediately afterward Curlie received a second reassuring message from the captain of
the liner. A short time after that he had the pleasure of escorting the dripping daughter of
a millionaire up the gangway.

The next day as they were moving in toward the dock, Vincent Ardmore approached Curlie.

"My sister," there was a strange smile on his lips, "says you set out on this trip for the
purpose of having me arrested?"

"I did."

"Well--" the other boy choked up and could not continue.

"The law, punishment, prisons and all that, as I understand it," said Curlie thoughtfully,
"have but one purpose: to teach people what other folks' rights are and to encourage them in
respecting them. It's my business to see that there is fair play in the air."

He paused and looked away at the sea. When he resumed there was a suspicious huskiness in his
voice. "Seems to me that as far as you are concerned, nature has punished you about enough.
You ought to know by this time what interfering with the radio wave lengths belonging to sea
traffic might mean to shipwrecked men; and--well--Oh, what's the use!" he broke off abruptly.
"I'm a chicken-hearted fool. You're out on parole and must report to your sister every week.
She's--she's what I'd call a brick!"

Turning hastily he walked away.

Almost before he knew it, he all but ran over Gladys Ardmore, coming to meet him.

"Oh, Mister--Mister--" she hesitated.

"Just plain Curlie," he smiled.

"You--you're coming to see me when you get home? Won't you?"

Curlie thought a moment, then of a sudden the spacious walls of the Ardmore mansion flashed
into his mind. To go there as an officer of the law was one thing; to go as a guest was quite
another.

"Why--why--" he drew back in confusion--"you'll have to excuse me but--but--"

"Oh! I know!" she exclaimed. "It's the house and everything. Tell you what," she seized him
by the arm; "there's a little old-fashioned farmhouse down in one corner of our estate. It
was there when we bought it and has been kept just the same ever since. Even the furniture,
red plush chairs, kitchen stove and everything, are there. We'll go down there and have a regular
frolic sometime, popcorn, molasses candy, checkers and everything. We've a wonderful cook who
once lived on a farm. We'll take her along as a chaperon. Now will you come? Will you?" she
urged eagerly.

"Why--why--"

"If you don't," she held up a warning finger, "I'll come up and visit you in that secret wireless
room of yours just as I once said I would."

"In that case," said Curlie, "I suppose I'll have to surrender. And," he added happily, "here
we are, back to dear old North America, without any gold but with a lot to be thankful for."

The boat was bumping against the dock. Giving his arm a squeeze the girl dashed away.

CHAPTER XXV

OFF ON ANOTHER WILD CHASE

A few nights later Curlie was back in the secret tower room. He was busy as ever running down
trouble.

Joe Marion, entering the room noiselessly, dropped a letter into his hand. The letter bore
the insignia of the Ardmore family in one corner.

"From Gladys Ardmore!" he told himself.

But he was mistaken. It was a typewritten letter signed in a bold business hand. It ran:

    "It is with great pleasure that I inclose a check for the sum
    of the reward offered for the safe return of my son.

                                      "(Signed) J. Anson Ardmore."

Curlie looked at the check, then uttered a low whistle.

"Pay to the order of C. Carson, $10,000.00," he whispered. Then out loud:

"Joe, what would a fellow do with ten thousand dollars?"

"Search me," Joe grinned back. "You got the fever or something?" he asked a second later.

Curlie showed him the check.

"Why," said Joe, "you might buy a car."

"Not much. The Humming Bird's quite good enough."

"Tell you what," he said after a moment's thought, "just get that cashed for me, will you?
Then find out where our old skipper and the engineer live and send them a thousand apiece.
After that pocket a thousand for yourself. Then--then--Oh, well, hire me a safety deposit box
and buy me a lot of Liberty bonds. Might want 'em some day.

"And, say, that reminds me," he pointed to a square of vellum which hung on a stretcher in
the corner. "Take that over to the big library on the North Side and tell 'em it's a present
from us. It's that map Vincent Ardmore gave me. It's worth a thousand dollars, but such maps
are not safe outside a library. Tell 'em to put it on ice," he laughed.

Scarcely had Joe departed than a keen-eyed, gray-haired man entered the tower room. He was
Colonel Edward Marshall, Curlie's superior.

"Curlie," he wrinkled his brow, as he took a seat, "there's somebody raising hob with the radio
service in Alaska."

Curlie nodded his head. "I thought there might be. Sends on 1200, doesn't he?" He was thinking
of the hotel mystery and of the strange girl who had whispered to him so often out of the night.

"Yes, how did you know so much?"

"Part of my job."

"But you've been away."

"Radiophone whispers travel far."

"Well," said the colonel, settling down to business, "Alaska's in a bad way. This fellow doesn't
confine himself to 1200 up there. He uses all sorts of wave lengths; seems to take pleasure
in mussing up important government communications and even more in breaking in on Munson."

"Munson, the Arctic explorer."

"Yes. He's making a try for the Pole. Much depends upon his keeping in touch with the outside
world and this crank or crook seems determined that he shall not."

"Why don't they catch him?"

"Well, you see," he wrinkled his brow again, "the boys up there are rather new at it. Don't
understand the radio compass very well. The fellow moves about and all that, so it's difficult.

"I thought," he said slowly after a moment, "that you might like to tackle the case."

"Would I?" exclaimed Curlie, jumping to his feet. "Try me! Can I take Joe along?"

"As you like. Better get off pretty promptly; say day after to-morrow."

"Never fear. We'll be off on time."

The colonel bowed and left the room.

"Alaska! Alaska!" Curlie murmured after a time, "Alaska and the Yukon trail, for of course
it will be that. It's too late for the boats. And that reminds me, I made a promise to Gladys
Ardmore. Only one night left."

A short time after that he put in an out-of-town telephone call. It was a girlish voice that
answered.

Late the next night Curlie made his way home along the well-remembered Forest Preserve road.
He was riding in the Humming Bird. He had been to Gladys Ardmore's party for two and a chaperon
down in the little farmhouse. The party had been a grand success and he was carrying away pleasant
memories which would serve him well on the long, long Yukon trail and the weary and eventful
miles which lay beyond its further terminal.

If you wish to learn of Curlie's adventures up there and of the secret of the whisperer, you
must read the next volume, entitled "On the Yukon Trail."
